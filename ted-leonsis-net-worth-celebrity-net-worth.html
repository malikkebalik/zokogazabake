A young Ted mowed lawns for extra money, and his high school guidance counselor deemed him destined to work in a grocery store. But while mowing the lawn owned by wealthy stockbroker and Georgetown alumnus, Jim Shannon, the wheels were set in motion. Shannon was impressed by the boy and helped him gain admission to Georgetown University after Ted graduated from Lowell High School.</p><p>Ted Leonsis became the first in his family to attend college, and he majored in American Studies and graduated at the top of his class in 1977. He then moved back to his parents' home in Lowell, Massachusetts, and began working for Wang Laboratories as a communications manager, and for Harris Corporation as a marketing executive.</p><h2 id=list-magazine><strong>LIST Magazine</strong></h2><p>Ted left Harris Corporation at 25 years old and moved to Florida to begin his first business venture, publishing "LIST," a technology magazine that mainly focused on personal computing. He ended up raising $1 million in capital along with his partner, Vicent Pica. The first issue was published in 1982 and proved to be a big success selling $50,000 worth of copies on the newsstands. It was two years later that Ted sold the company to Thomson Reuters for $40 million, netting him $20 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166891 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/GettyImages-167320992.jpg alt="Ted Leonsis" width=396 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-166891 class=wp-caption-text>Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images</p><h2 id=aol><strong>AOL</strong></h2><p>Ted Leonsis is probably best known as the Internet industry pioneer who was instrumental in turning AOL (previously known as America Online) into a global phenomenon.
