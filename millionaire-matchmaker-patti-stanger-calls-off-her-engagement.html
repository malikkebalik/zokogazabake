I don’t watch those house-flipping shows (the one with the anal retentive guy), and I also avoid the Top Chefs, just because I know I could easily fall for that show and I don’t want to get addicted – I’ve already got too much programming to keep up with. But my one exception to Bravo’s cheese-tastic Millionaire Matchmaker. My favorite day of the weekend is any Saturday when Bravo runs a marathon of Millionaire Matchmaker. I could sit and watch these foolish, ridiculous (older) men and their desire for young, nubile, dumb girlfriends all day long.</p><p>Every now and then, a rare gem of a man comes along and wants a genuine partner, or wants Matchmaker Patti Stanger to find him someone nice and age-appropriate. But most of the time it’s Patti talking to some a–hole in his 40s about how he wants someone “in their early 20s, no older.” Patti usually comes out and tells them that they need to go for someone older, and she usually tells them that they’re an a–hole. She’s honest, and I have a strange affection for her. But I’m not always so sure she knows what she’s doing. And personally, I’ve always wondered why some people aren’t like, “Hey, Patti, you don’t have your love life together, why should you be the one setting me up?”</p><p>All of this to say that Patti and her fiancé have split up. Patti tells Life & Style Mag that it was all about babies, and her wanting some and him not so much:</p><p>Life & Style can exclusively reveal that Millionaire Matchmaker Patti Stanger has called it quits with her fiancé and boyfriend of six and a half years, Andy Friedman.</p><p>“I want a kid now and Andy doesn’t,” Patti tells Life & Style about why she and her longtime beau have decided to go their separate ways. “My dealbreaker has always been kids.”</p><p>Patti and Andy, who got engaged on her birthday last year, May 31, 2009, initially set a 2010 wedding date, but continued to push back their plans when Patti couldn’t get Andy to commit to raising a family.</p><p>“Ever since our first date, he knew I wanted kids, and then something along the way changed,” says the candid cupid.</p><p>“Andy’s a great guy and we’ll always remain friends, but he wants me to be something that I can’t be. We’re better friends than lovers.”</p><p>The third generation matchmaker is confident that her real soulmate is just around the corner. “A good guy is out there for me, I know it,” says Patti, who still hopes to be a stepmom or adopt. “A life without kids has no meaning to me. I think the most important job in the world is being a parent or stepparent!”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Life & Style</a>]</p><p>Matchmakers: just as f-cked up in love as the rest of us! No, I like how honest Patti is and how she was willing to cash out of the wedding fantasy because he wouldn’t agree to be a father. Hey, she could have just gotten pregnant and been like, “You’ll agree to now, won’t you?” Sigh… hopefully Patti will find herself a nice guy.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view2.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/8225701/bravo-media-2010-upfront/bravo-media-2010-upfront.jpg border=0 width=500 title="Bravo Media's 2010 Upfront Party" height=681 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="Mar 10, 2010 - New York, New York, USA - Reality personality PATTI STANGER from 'Millionaire Matchmaker' attends Bravo Media's 2010 Upfront Party held at Skylight Studios. &amp;copy; Red Carpet Pictures" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view2.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/8224394/bravos-upfront-party-new/bravos-upfront-party-new.jpg border=0 width=500 title="Bravos Upfront Party New York City" height=750 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="Mar. 10, 2010 - New York, New York, United States - PATTI STANGER from ''The Millionaire Matchmaker'' arriving at Bravo Media's 2010 Upfront Party at Skylight Studios in New York City on 03-10-2010. 2010. .K64457HMc. &amp;copy; Red Carpet Pictures" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view4.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/4629187/weekly-hot-hollywood-party/weekly-hot-hollywood-party.jpg border=0 width=500 title="US Weekly Hot Hollywood Party" height=750 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="Patti Stanger arriving at the US Weekly Hot Hollywood Party at MyHouse Club in .Los Angeles, California on April 22, Kathy Hutchins / Hutchins Photo.... .
