I was disappointed to receive a very sad-looking Chicken Tenders Platter from Applebee's. Maybe it’s a plating issue, but I wasn't exactly excited to hop in. Regardless, the chicken had a nice crunch to it, though it was nothing to brag about. To their credit, I enjoyed the thin, salty fries, and the honey mustard gave a good tang to the dish.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lindsey Updyke</span></span></figure><p><span style=font-weight:400>The three-course meal deal at Applebee's runs on three prices, $16.99, $21.99, and $26.99, with a variety of dishes under each price.

Not to mention, the deal at Chili's also provides you with a $5 drink deal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The absence of a drink deal at my Applebee's location to compare certainly hurt my wallet more, too. While my Chili’s meal cost just over $25, I spent nearly $60 at Applebee's. With far more impressive portion sizes and overall better food, I ordered the same amount of food at Chili's for just half the Applebee’s price. </span><span style=font-weight:400></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>By the end of my judgment, the winner was clear.
