EMS arrives with a patient, LeAnn Crawford, who has just given birth to the baby on the sidewalk, the baby is still attached to the umbilical cord and she is yelling for them to get “it” away from her.</p><p>Maggie Lockwood (Marlyne Barrett) calls for Dr. Ethan Choi (Brian Tee) and Dr. Manning to her. She is very combative and yanks the cord to get the baby away from her. Dr. Choi has to deliver the placenta to prevent her from bleeding out as Dr. Manning tries to bring up the temperature of the baby. LeAnn is screaming for them to kill the baby. After Dr. Choi is able to calm her down, he tells LeAnn that she just had a baby but tells April Sexton (Yaya DaCosta) to call Child and Family Services as there is no way she is taking the baby home.</p><p>Dr. Charles tells Natalie and Choi that LeAnn is okay after some methadone and they are going to talk to her about detox. Natalie is worried about the baby having the same results. Dr. Charles meets with LeAnn who just wants to go but he tells her that DCFS is on the way to arrange a custodian for her child. When he questions her about her drug use, Ethan interrupts him and says he won’t get through to her and is wasting his time as she doesn’t even want to talk to him; Dr. Charles disagrees.</p><p>Barry (James Vincent Meredith) comes to see Maggie, trying to convince Maggie to have dinner with him. She keeps rejecting him, saying they are not going to have a date.</p><p>Lyla Dempsey (Garcelle Beauvais) comes in with Bert Goodwin (Gregory Alan Williams) to see Dr. Halstead. She has a cough and a fever, admitting it is harder and harder to swallow the past while. Dr. Halstead feels that she might have developed pneumonia and is going to start her on antibiotics and take some cultures for testing. In the hallway, Bert tells Will that he knows she has a degenerative disease and he won’t have her forever, but her mind is all there so he would like to take her home. He promises to do everything he can.</p><p>Ethan asks April out for dinner, but she says she is going to watch her brother, Dr. Noah Sexton (Roland Buck III) hockey game later; which leads them into a misunderstanding since she feels family isn’t important to him as he never speaks about them; he says there is nothing to talk about.</p><p>Dr. Rhodes asks Dr. Ava Bekker (Norma Kuhling) if she can cover for him tomorrow. She feels him chasing after Robin is a “fool’s errand.” Dr. Stanley Stohl (Eddie Jemison) interrupts them, saying CFD has a man trapped in a collapsed building, an ambulance is waiting to take them both.</p><p>Dr. Charles comes to see Sharon Goodwin (S. Epatha Merkerson) who wants to know the status of Dr. Sarah Reese’s (Rachel DiPillo) probation. Sharon wants a detailed progress report once Sarah returns to work; Dr. Charles says he will no longer be supervising her anymore and she will be working under Dr. Chapman. He mentions that Bert is back in the hospital today.</p><p>April tells Dr. Manning that the baby is inconsolable and his heart rate is too high and his oxygen levels are dropping; he also isn’t eating. April is about to check his labs, but Natalie tells her it isn’t necessary as the baby is addicted to heroin and going through withdrawal.</p><p>Dr. Manning talks to Dr. Charles and Dr. Choi, saying the baby’s stats are not improving and statistics show that babies that are not thriving do significantly better when they have physical contact with their biological mothers. Choi thinks it is a horrible idea since LeAnn tried to kill him and had 9-months to do right by the baby. Dr. Charles’ concern is with LeAnn and says it is not a good idea. Sharon informs Natalie that DCFS might have found foster parents and they are on their way as she walks away Sharon runs into Bert, who says he is hanging in there and doing the best he can with Lyla.</p><p>Dr. Reese is told that once she returns to work at the psychiatric ward, she will do rounds twice a day, do chart review every morning and she will observe group therapy every afternoon; residency is a time to watch and absorb. Dr. Chapman is not interested in hearing about any new therapies and ideas, she tells Sarah to read the charts and understand the flows and if the patients are responding to medications.</p><p>Dr. Rhodes and Dr. Bekker arrive at the building and are greeted by CFD Lt. Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney) and Joe Cruz (Joe Minoso); they tell him about Gary who has a huge piece of concrete crushing his leg. Christopher Herrmann (David Eigenberg) introduces them to Gary as they begin to figure out a way to free him.</p><p>Dr. Will Halstead returns to Lyla’s room, asking Doris (Lorena Diaz) to run another set of labs. The antibiotics are not working and she learns the bacteria has possibly spread from her lungs to her blood, meaning she has sepsis. He’s hopeful but worries he might have to intubate her before she gets better. She stops him, but he says if her lungs fail and he doesn’t intubate, she will die. She knows and he finally understands what she is saying.</p><p>Dr. Charles returns to see LeAnn, telling her about the baby’s struggles. She says to just give him some medicine, but he explains that it isn’t that simple. LeAnn begins to quiver as he explains that the baby needs her to feel better and she is the best medicine they have for the baby. She realizes the baby is sick because of her and there is no way more of her is going to help “it”. She tells Dr. Charles to leave her alone.</p><p>Sharon comes to see Lyla, who says that Bert is a good man who shouldn’t be alone. Lyla explains that she signed a do not resuscitate letter and asks when her time comes if Sharon would think about being there for Bert. Sharon leaves without saying anything.</p><p>At the building site, Rhodes and Bekker can’t clamp the artery and Herrmann tells them there is no way they can get him out of there. Dr. Rhodes says there are going to put a balloon inside him, but Bekker disagrees saying once they do that, they only have 30 minutes from then to save him; Dr. Rhodes says he needs to stop the bleeding because if he doesn’t do this, Gary will bleed out right now.</p><p>Sarah comes to see Dr. Charles in his office, she says she prefers to come back to his service but he feels it is important for her to explore a different clinical approach. She confronts him about his feeling her PTSD stems from him being shot, and their working together is affecting her mental health. She says HE chose to bring her into psychiatry and she isn’t going to be pawned off to another psychiatrist when he is the psychiatrist she wants to be like. He appreciates what she is saying, but says the best course of action is she sticks with Dr. Chapman.</p><p>Bert is very upset that Lyla chose this, Dr. Halstead explains that there is nothing else he can do as she made her wishes very clear. Bert starts to shout at him and both Sharon and Maggie try to calm him down. Sharon encourages him to calm down and be with Lyla.</p><p>Dr. Choi comes to see LeAnn, who asks him if she should go see her baby. He explains that he is sick as she says she never planned on getting pregnant. Dr. Choi doesn’t judge her, simply saying he wished things worked out differently for her and the baby. She looks at him, saying he wouldn’t understand considering where he came from. He looks her dead in the eyes and says, he understands better than she thinks.</p><p>Barry startles Maggie, asking if she is hungry yet? He talks to her about their first date, and how he threw a penny into the fountain hoping for another date with her. She said he cheated on her, but he promises he has changed; she doesn’t buy it. He finally gives up and walks out of the ED.</p><p>The firefighters keep trying to cut the concrete but Rhodes is told the building is too unstable. Bekker tells Rhodes the leg is already cold and Rhodes tells Gary they need to amputate his leg, it has been without blood for too long. Gary tells them to get away but Bekker tells him they don’t want to take his leg but he is in grave danger. He begs that there has to be another way, she tells him there are a lot of years to live but he says not without a leg. Bekker tells him Dr. Rhodes is going to numb him up and for him to keep looking at him as Dr. Rhodes saws off his leg.</p><p>April and Dr. Manning continue to work on the baby, his stats continue to drop, Dr. Charles watches as they fight to save him. Dr. Manning says if this happens again, they need to put the baby on a ventilator.</p><p>Lyla tells Dr. Halstead she has changed her mind and if he needs to take extreme measures to save her, then do it because she doesn’t want to Bert to be alone as he didn’t leave her when he found out she was terminally ill. Meanwhile, Dr. Charles talks to LeAnn again about holding the baby, saying he might die without her holding him. She cries, saying it is her fault, that she did it to him but she will try. With Dr. Choi and Dr. Charles at her side, LeAnn is brought into the room in a wheelchair. She comments on how small he is as April shows her how to hold him, skin-to-skin. She talks to him as he calms down.</p><p>Maggie calls in Dr. Halstead when Lyla’s alarms go off. He is about to shock her heart back into rhythm when Bert finally realizes she is only doing it for him. He tells Dr. Halstead to stop! When Dr. Halstead asks Lyla what she wants him to do, she refuses the extreme measures after she looks at Bert. He leans in and tells her he loves her and she says it back before she takes her final breath and passes away. Sharon stands to the side as Will checks for a pulse and confirms the time of death.</p><p>Dr. Rhodes and Dr. Bekker arrive with Gary, telling them to prepare OR. Dr. Stohl sees the balloon and says that was a problem waiting to happen; Rhodes says it was his decision and Bekker says it was the right call, there was no other way to get the patient out alive. They are able to remove the steel bar without any bleeding; Dr. Bekker comments on a “good job” to Dr. Rhodes and they head up to the OR.</p><p>Sharon notices Bert sitting outside the hospital on a bench. Dr. Charles stops DCFS from going into the room, saying he needs to speak to LeAnn Crawford before they go in. Dr. Charles tells her they made room for him in the NICU, she asks if she carries him up or does they take him up in the warmer? He explains that there is a foster couple that will be taking care of him from here on out. She begins to cry saying he likes her so much and the baby is doing so well, so she should keep holding him. The DCFS worker comes in and says they need to take the baby now.</p><p>LeAnn begins to scream that she is his mother and pleads with Dr. Charles to help her. He goes with her while the worker and nurses go with the baby separately; Dr. Manning watches everything unfold sadly.</p><p>Sharon and Maggie leave the hospital. Maggie wonders if people can change, Sharon says she doesn’t know and leaves. Dr. Choi wishes Maggie would stay because she lost a lot of blood as Dr. Charles wants her to stay in the methadone clinic, saying if she gets cleaned up, its the crucial first step in getting him back. She says she is tired and just wants to go; nothing they can say will stop her. Dr. Charles comments that it is sad, that it is most likely that neither one of them will ever be whole again. His comment affects Choi.</p><p>Dr. Charles finds Dr. Reese admitting he feels responsible for letting her situation get out of hand the way it did. He would welcome her back to his service if she still wants to.</p><p>Dr. Rhodes comes to see Gary after surgery, he says it feels weird that he can still feel his leg. Dr. Rhodes tells him it is called “phantom limb pain”, it takes some time, but it will fade. He apologizes about his leg, but Gary is grateful to be alive and will find a way to move on. Rhodes finds Dr. Charles and says that he didn’t want to believe it, but he was right and needs to find a way to let Robin go.</p><p>April is looking at the tiny little boy in the NICU when Ethan finds her and shows her a photo of a girl on his phone, saying it is his sister, Emily. He doesn’t talk about her to people, his parents adopted Emily when she was 4 and she had a hard life before she came to them and still does. She acts out and every time he helps her, he swears it was the last time 4 years ago. His eyes well up with tears and feel he should give her a call.</p><p>Dr. Rhodes tells Dr. Bekker she was great today and tells her she doesn’t need to cover for him as he isn’t going to Minneapolis. Instead, he goes to Porsche dealership, saying he is looking for a change. He wants the keys, saying he isn’t going for a test-drive, he is buying it.</p><p>The alarm sounds, waking Will and Natalie. He tells her he will see her in the morning but she pulls him back into bed, telling him to stay. He asks about Owen and she says that he has to find out sometime. He snuggles up, saying this is so much better than scrapping up himself in the middle of the night, every night. She giggles.</p><p>END</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaHFnk522pK3GqGSmnZRiv6avwKlkamVha3pyhIysnJqrn6N6dHnEqaCsp5Saenh5zq%2Bcq2Wkp7y2rsuem2avkamys3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
