Even though&nbsp;<a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>&nbsp;is coming to an end, Disick probably won’t go anywhere any time soon.</p><p id=par-2_44>He has his clothing brand, Talentless. He has been on&nbsp;KUWTK&nbsp;spinoffs before, so he may end up staying on TV even though his surrogate family won’t have their own show anymore. Disick has always provided much needed snark on KUWTK,&nbsp;making him a fan favorite.</p><p id=par-3_27>Disick seems perfectly at home with the Kardashian-Jenner family, and in fact they’ve become like family to him. But was he born into money like they were?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Scott Disick’s net worth today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scott-disick.jpg><p id=par-4_26>While Disick’s <a href=#>current net worth</a> of $40 million has skyrocketed thanks to his association with the Kardashians, he was never exactly hard up for cash.</p><p id=par-5_19>Fans recently discussed Disick’s upbringing on <a href=#>Reddit</a>, and most of them agree that he definitely had money growing up.</p><p id=par-6_40>Disick’s grandfather was an attorney who got into real estate. His father continued the family business, and Disick got involved at a young age. He was also a model when he was younger, solidifying his place in high society.</p><p id=par-7_33>Now he seems to have set his sights on reality TV and fashion rather than real estate, but he probably has a few irons in the fire in the housing market as well.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Scott Disick’s grandfather started the family business</h2><p id=par-8_26>Disick’s grandfather is the one he has to thank for his comfortable upbringing. According to <a href=#>Heavy</a>, thanks to the family business, Disick’s parents were extremely wealthy.</p><p id=par-9_28>Unfortunately, <a href=#>Disick lost both his parents</a> close together, and it was fairly traumatic for him. His mom passed in 2013, and he lost his dad in 2014.</p><p id=par-10_36>He is an only child, so even though he’s no longer with Kourtney Kardashian, he remains close to the Kardashian-Jenner family. He treats her siblings as if they were his own, and the feeling seems mutual.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>If it weren’t for his wealth, Scott Disick would have never met Kourtney Kardashian</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_63>Disick is currently worth a whopping $40 million, but he was never exactly poor. In fact, he and Kourtney <a href=#>would have never met</a> if it weren’t for his wealth. Kourtney and Disick met at a party at Joe Francis’ house. Francis is famous for creating the&nbsp;Girls Gone Wild&nbsp;franchise, and at one point, due to his fame and wealth, he and Kourtney were involved.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_42>Disick’s wealth led him to run in the same socialite circles as Francis, and he subsequently met Kourtney at a party at Francis’ beach side mansion. The two were from opposite coasts. Disick was from New York, and Kourtney from California.</p><p id=par-13_29>Still, they had a lot in common. Disick’s grandfather was a lawyer, and so was Kourtney’s dad. Robert Kardashian Sr. made the family fortune, as did Disick’s grandfather.</p><p id=par-14_29>Even though they were from opposite ends in the country, they somehow ran with the same crowd. If Disick didn’t come from money, he would have never met Kourtney.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxqrCMrJqorKRisaq%2FyJyiZpuforJustGopGaZXae2pLSMn5imoZyueqOxxaipnmWYmnqusdNmoqitoqm7psWMpJirnJGotaqtzWefraWcZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
