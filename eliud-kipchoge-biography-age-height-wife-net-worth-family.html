The run did not count as a new marathon record, as standard competition rules for pacing and fluids were not followed and it was not an open event.</p><p>Following his performances in the 2018 season, Kipchoge received numerous accolades and awards. He was named IAAF World Athlete of the Year together with Caterine Ibargüen, who received the female World Athlete of the Year award. On 11 January 2019, Kipchoge was also named the 2018 Sportsman of the Year at the Kenyan Sports Personality of the Year Awards in Mombasa, Kenya, beating fellow contenders for the coveted trophy, athlete <a href=#>Hellen Obiri</a>, boxer Fatuma Zarika and rugby star Janet Okelo.</p><p>Kipchoge won the 2019 London Marathon in a time of 2:02:37, the second fastest marathon of all time, behind his 2018 Berlin Marathon win. His fourth win in London marks a new course record, beating his own 2016 London Marathon record by 28 seconds. The lead runner passed the half marathon mark in 1:01:37. <a href=#>Mosinet Geremew</a> (Ethiopia) finished as the runner up in 2:02:55 and <a href=#>Mule Wasihun</a> (Ethiopia) came in third place in 2:03:16. The British runner Mo Farah (4 time Olympic Gold medalist), a pre-race favorite, finished 5th.</p><p>In May 2019, a few days after his London Marathon win, Kipchoge announced another take on the sub-two-hour marathon, named the Ineos 1:59 Challenge. On 12 October 2019 in Vienna's Prater park, he ran 4.4 laps of the Hauptallee in 1:59:40, becoming the first person in recorded history to break the two hour barrier over a marathon distance.</p><p>On 16 September 2018, Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:01:39, breaking the previous world record by 1 minute and 18 seconds (2:02:57 set by fellow countryman Dennis Kimetto at the Berlin Marathon in 2014). It was the greatest improvement in a marathon world record time since 1967. He finished 4:43 min ahead of second-placed fellow Kenyan <a href=#>Amos Kipruto</a>. The World Record holder from 2013, Wilson Kipsang of Kenya, came in third at 2:06:48.</p><p>The effort did not count as a new world record under IAAF rules due to the setup of the challenge. Specifically, it was not an open event, Kipchoge was handed fluids by his support team throughout, the run featured a pace car, and included rotating teams of other runners pacing Kipchoge in a formation designed to reduce wind resistance and maximize efficiency. The achievement was recognized by Guinness World Records with the titles ‘Fastest marathon distance (male)’ and ‘First marathon distance run under two hours’.</p><p>On 6 May 2017, Kipchoge, along with <a href=#>Zersenay Tadese</a> (then world record holder in the half marathon) and <a href=#>Lelisa Desisa</a> (2 time Boston Marathon winner), attempted the first sub-two-hour assisted marathon, in the Nike Breaking2 project on the Monza Formula 1 racetrack near Milan, Italy. All 3 runners ran a test 2 months before the attempt. The target time was 1 hour for a half Marathon. Kipchoge finished first in 59:17. The course was measured at 2400&nbsp;m per lap. During the 2 hour attempt, the runners were paced by a lead car and 30 supporting pacers joining in stages (both considered illegal under IAAF rules). The race started at 5:45h local time on the 2.4&nbsp;km track. Kipchoge finished in 2:00:25, while the other two had to slow and finished far behind. The runners planned even 14:13 5k splits to break 2 hours. His 5k splits were: 14:14, 14:07, 14:13, 14:15, 14:14, 14:17, 14:17, 14:27, and 6:20 to finish. The 5k split times from 25k and further would be world records: 25k in 1:11:03, 30k in 1:25:20, 35k in 1:39:37, 40k in 1:54:04.</p><p>On 24 September 2017, he won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:03:32. In rainy conditions, he finished 14 seconds ahead of <a href=#>Guye Adola</a> who ran his first marathon. Adola set the fastest marathon debut ever. Former marathon world record holder Wilson Kipsang and 2016 winner <a href=#>Kenenisa Bekele</a> failed to finish.</p><p>In April 2016, Kipchoge won the London Marathon for the second consecutive year in a time of 2:03:05. His performance broke the course record in London, and became the second-fastest marathon time in history, missing Dennis Kimetto's world record by 8 seconds.</p><p>As the prerace favorite, during the 2016 Summer Olympics, Kipchoge gained a gold medal in the marathon event. On the last day of the Rio Olympics on 21 August 2016 he won in a time of 2:08:44. The runner up was <a href=#>Feyisa Lilesa</a> (Ethiopia) 2:09:54 and the bronze medal went to Galen Rupp (USA), doing his second marathon, crossing the finish line in 2:10:05. When the halfway point after 21.0975&nbsp;km was reached, 37 men were within 10 seconds of the lead runner. The participants field diminished to 3 lead runners shortly before 34&nbsp;km. Kipchoge made his final move on silver medal winner Lilesa around 36&nbsp;km into the race. He covered the first half of the race in 1:05:55, while doing the second half in 1:02:49, that amounts to a difference of more than 3 minutes, a negative split. The winning gap between Kipchoge and Lilesa by 70 seconds was the largest victory margin since the 1972 Olympic marathon. Kipchoge's winning time of 2:08:44 is his slowest marathon time (as of Mar 2020). One hundred fifty-five runners started the race, which amounted to the largest field in Olympic history; 140 of them finished the race. With this win, Kipchoge became the second Kenyan male after Sammy Wanjiru in Beijing 2008 to win an Olympic marathon gold medal. At the same Olympics, the women's marathon was won by <a href=#>Jemima Sumgong</a> in turn she became the first female Kenyan winner.</p><p>On 20 November 2016, Kipchoge ran in the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon, winning the race clocking a time of 59:44.</p><p>On 2 February 2015 Kipchoge participated in the Ras al-Khaimah Half Marathon. He placed sixth with a time of 1:00:50. The run was won by <a href=#>Mosinet Geremew</a> (Ethiopia) in 1:00:05.</p><p>Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon in 2015. His win and then-personal-best time (2:04:00) occurred even though his shoes malfunctioned, causing his insoles to flap out of both shoes from 10&nbsp;km onward; rather than risk time lost from an adjustment, he finished the race with bloodied, blistered feet.</p><p>Kipchoge opened his 2013 season with a win at the Barcelona Half Marathon in a time of one hour and four seconds. Making his marathon debut in April, he demonstrated a smooth transition to the longer distance by taking the Hamburg Marathon title with a run of 2:05:30 hours—beating the field by over two minutes and setting a new course record. In August 2013, he won the Half Marathon of Klagenfurt in 1:01:02 minutes.</p><p>He switched to road running in 2012 and made the second-fastest half marathon debut ever, at 59:25. In his marathon debut, he won the 2013 Hamburg Marathon in a course record time. His first victory at a World Marathon Major came at the Chicago Marathon in 2014, and he went on to become series champion for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. He won the London Marathon a record 4 times, and won the Olympic marathon in 2016. His only loss in a marathon was a second place behind <a href=#>Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich</a> at the 2013 Berlin Marathon, where Kipsang broke the world record.</p><p>Kipchoge returned to the Edinburgh Cross Country in 2012, but this time he finished third behind <a href=#>Asbel Kiprop</a> and Britain's <a href=#>Jonathan Hay</a>. He was also third at the Carlsbad 5000 in March. He attempted to gain a place on the 10,000&nbsp;m Olympic team at the Prefontaine Classic, but fell back in the late stages of the Kenyan trial race, finishing seventh. A seventh-place finish in the Kenyan 5000&nbsp;m trial race meant he would not make a third consecutive Olympic team.</p><p>On 6 October 2012 Kipchoge run in the 2012 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Kavarna Bulgaria. Zsersenay Tadese of Eritrea won in 1:00:19 and Kipchoge placed sixth in 1:01:52.</p><p>At the start of 2011, he won the short race at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country, ahead of <a href=#>Asbel Kiprop</a>. He attempted to retain his title at the Carlsbad 5000 in April but came a close second behind <a href=#>Dejen Gebremeskel</a>. In May he raced the 3000 metres (finished third) in Doha, with a time of 7:27.66 and ranked him as the 12th-fastest at the distance up to this point. Kipchoge was chosen to represent Kenya at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and reached the 5000&nbsp;m final for the fifth consecutive time, although he only managed seventh place on this occasion.</p><p>He made his debut on the 2010 IAAF Diamond League by winning the 5000&nbsp;m Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix in a meet record time.</p><p>In the first athletics final of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, he attempted to win the 5000&nbsp;m Commonwealth title. Ugandan runner Moses Kipsiro held a slender lead over him in the final stages of the race and Kipchoge ended up in second place, taking the silver medal some seven hundredths of a second behind. He flew back to Europe immediately after to take part in the Belgrade Race through History the following day. His shoe fell off in the first kilometre and, after putting it back on, he made up much ground on the field to eventually take second place two seconds behind Josphat Menjo.</p><p>He failed to reach the podium at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, finishing in fifth place and he also finished ninth in the 3000&nbsp;m at the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.</p><p>During the 2008 Olympics held in Beijing, China, Kipchoge won a silver medal in the 5000&nbsp;m event with a time of 13:02.80; although better than the previous Olympic record of 13:05.59, it was not enough to match Kenenisa Bekele's pace, who won the gold medal for this race. On the circuit, he won the Great Yorkshire Run 10K and Campaccio Cross Country that year.</p><p>He made his half marathon debut in the Lille Half Marathon. The run was won by a new course record time of 59:05 (previously 59:36 by ilahun Regassa set in 2008) from Ezekiel Chebii (former pb 59:22), trailed by Bernard Koech 59:10, and Kipchoge earned a third place with 59:25. His time of 59:25 became the second fastest Half Marathon debut, only second to Moses Mosop's 59:20 in Milan in 2010.</p><p>In July he participated in the Golden League 2004 Roma Meeting. In the 5000&nbsp;m event, he dipped first among the starters with 12:46.53, which made him the sixth-fastest ever in the event.</p><p>In 2004, Kipchoge won a bronze medal at the 5000 m final at the 2004 Athens Olympics, behind El Guerrouj and <a href=#>Kenenisa Bekele</a>. He also won the Trofeo Alasport cross country race earlier that season.</p><p>Kipchoge won his first individual world championship title in 2003 by winning the junior race at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships and setting a world junior record over 5000&nbsp;m on the track. At the age of eighteen, he became the senior 5000&nbsp;m world champion at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics with a championships record, then followed with an Olympic bronze for Kenya in 2004 and a bronze at the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships. A five-time World Championship 5000&nbsp;m finalist, Kipchoge took silver medals at the 2007 World Championships, 2008 Summer Olympics and 2010 Commonwealth Games.</p><p>In 2002, he won at the Kenyan trials for the 2002 IAAF World Cross Country Championships junior race. At the World Cross Country Championships, held in Dublin, Kipchoge finished fifth in the individual race and was part of the Kenyan junior team that won gold. Kipchoge also won the 5000 metres race at the Kenyan trial for the 2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics, but fell ill and missed the championships. At the 2003 IAAF World Cross Country Championships he won the junior race.</p><p>Eliud Kipchoge EGH (English: /ˌ ɛ l i ˈ uː d k ɪ p ˈ tʃ oʊ ɡ ə / EL -ee-OOD kip-CHOH -gə; born 5 November 1984) is a Kenyan long-distance runner who competes in the marathon and formerly the 5000 metres. He is the world record holder in the marathon with a time of 2:01:39, set on 16 September 2018, at the 2018 Berlin Marathon. His run broke the previous world record by 1 minute and 18 seconds. Described as "the greatest marathoner of the modern era", Kipchoge has won 12 of the 13 marathons he has entered.</p><p>Kipchoge was born on 5 November 1984 in Kapsisiywa, Nandi County, in Kenya. Kipchoge graduated from Kaptel Secondary School in 1999 but did not run seriously then. He ran two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) to school on a daily basis. Kipchoge was raised by a single mother (a teacher), and only knew his father from pictures. He is the youngest of four children. He met his trainer <a href=#>Patrick Sang</a> (a former Olympic medalist in the steeplechase) in 2001 at the age of 16.</p><p>Then, he raced in the Berlin Marathon and he finished second in 2:04:05, the fifth-fastest time in history, in his second ever marathon, behind Wilson Kipsang, who set a new marathon world record with 2:03:23. Third place went to Geoffrey Kipsang of Kenya with 2:06:26. This was one of 11 world record since 1977 set at the Berlin Marathon (As of 2019).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmrmqwcNmoqKok528qLE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
