Preller</strong>&nbsp;closed in on <strong>Xander Bogaerts</strong>, a free agent whose signing would cost the Padres $1 million in 2024 international bonus pool money.</p><p>Kemp was not concerned that the Bogaerts addition would thwart plans to land 17-year-old Dominican shortstop <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leodalis De Vries</a>.</strong></p><p>Perhaps because it wasn’t all about money.</p><p>“It’s a very special day for me,” De Vries said through an interpreter when he signed on Jan. 15, “especially because it’s something that we’ve thought about for so long.</p><p>De Vries cited <strong>Fernando Tatis Jr.</strong>, <strong>Manny Machado</strong> and<strong> Jurickson Profar</strong> as examples of the Padres’ Latin star power, which made him a fan of the team.</p><p>De Vries signed for $4.2 million, accounting for all but $450,000 of the Padres’ pool. It was the second-highest bonus of the signing period. The Braves signed shortstop <strong>Jose Perdomo</strong>&nbsp;for $5 million.</p><p>The 6-foot-2, 175-pound De Vries is the son of a member of the Dominican Republic’s national basketball team. He’s also a switch-hitter who has been mentored by Guardians all-star <strong>Jose Ramirez</strong>.</p><p>De Vries runs a 6.6-second 60-yard dash and projects as a potential five-tool middle infielder.</p><p>“He loves to hit,” said Kemp, adding that De Vries is proficient from both sides of the plate.</p><p>“There’s a little more power from the right (side),” Kemp said. “I think lefthanded he’s able to spray the ball line to line . . . He’s going to have the ability to steal bases.</p><p>“(He has) instincts at shortstop. That’s where you really see the leadership and kind of taking control of the field.”</p><p>The Padres’ top international signing last year was Venezuelan catcher <strong>Ethan Salas</strong>, who began his pro career at Low-A Lake Elsinore a few days shy of his 17th birthday.</p><p>The plan for De Vries may not be quite as aggressive, but the Padres expect him to attend minor league spring training in Peoria, Ariz.</p><p>“Obviously, he’s a special, talented player,” Kemp said, “but we’re more excited about the person and getting him around as many people as we can in our organization.”</p><p><strong>FATHER FIGURES</strong></p><p>— Padres assistant farm director <strong>Mike Daly</strong>&nbsp;will add a new title to his résumé this year: High-A Fort Wayne manager. Daly will continue to serve as an AFD under farm director <strong>Ryley Westman</strong>.</p><p>Other notable changes to the Padres’ player development structure include <strong>Pete Zamora</strong>&nbsp;managing Triple-A El Paso after managing Low-A Lake Elsinore last year; former Chihuahuas manager <strong>Phillip Wellman</strong>&nbsp;taking on bench coach duties in the Arizona Complex League and former big leaguers <strong>Craig Stammen</strong>, <strong>A.J. Ellis</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Allen Craig</strong> serving in hybrid positions that will split their time between the minors and the big league team.</p><p>— The Padres’ non-roster invitees to big league camp include several Top 30 Prospects: catcher <strong>Ethan Salas</strong>, shortstop <strong>Jackson Merrill</strong>, lefthanders <strong>Robby Snelling</strong> and <strong>Austin Krob</strong>, righthanders <strong>Drew Thorpe</strong>, <strong>Adam Mazur</strong> and <strong>Randy Bergert</strong>; third basemen <strong>Graham Pauley</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Marcos Castanon</strong> and outfielder <strong>Jakob Marsee</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufony0wM6roJ6rX6Wupb7ErGSsnZVir7O1xqGrZp6lqcKzsYyfpqtlpKS9brXNrZyrppGptrC6wKVkrKGXo7Kmecuepp2ZnJ7AbrDEZq2roZWofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
