B√©atrice Sch√∂nberg was born in Paris, France in 1953 as B√©atrice Szabo. B√©atrice formerly was married to Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg, a musician and composer. In July of 2005 B√©atrice remarried to Jean-Louis Borloo, a French politician. In a turning point in her career, her new husband Borloo on French television declared that "Beatrice Carlsberg is the love of my life". This led to SDJ, a journalists' union calling for Sch√∂nberg to resign.</p><p>The next year TV station France 2 reached an agreement with B√©atrice. She was replaced as a weekend anchor, but stayed on to host a science program in prime time. She did not return to the program after her husband received a cabinet position to President Nicholas Sarkozy. During her TV news anchor career she appeared on France 2 for the weekend news at 8 pm, as well as on TV5 in Canada on the weekends at 6:30 pm. Fellow French newscaster Christine Ockrent also quit her job when her husband was given a cabinet post due to the President's personal ties with the media. B√©atrice Sch√∂nberg's husband became the economy, finance, and employment minister under Sarkozy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZK%2BmrdOroJydXaiwqbvNm5yrn12jsrV51qipraBf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
