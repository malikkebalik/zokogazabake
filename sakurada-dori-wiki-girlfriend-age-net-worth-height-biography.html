The actor grew up in a loving household alongside his elder brother, sister, and younger sister. At 11, the actor was spotted by an Amuse’s scout while he was going home on foot with his mother. The scout talked to his parents and recruited the little guy.</p><p>For years Dori took proper training in acting, dancing, and singing. He took training as a voice artist who later helped him when Shotaro Ishinomori chose him for the voice-over of the Kamen Rider video games.</p><p>Working with Amuse, he started with a musical drama, “The Prince of Tennis.” He was also in a boy band which was later dismantled. In 2008, Sakurada debuted as an actor in the film “Aquarian Age: Juvenile Orion.” It was an action drama featuring Keita Kimura, Takeru Satoh, Rakuto Tochihara, and Takuya Uehara.</p><p>The same year he worked on “Farewell Kamen Rider Den-O: Final Countdown,” which earned more than ¥720 million at the box office.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Sakurada Dori in Perfect Crime" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sakurada-Dori-in-Perfect-Crime.jpg alt="Sakurada Dori in Perfect Crime" width=400 height=413 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Sakurada Dori’s Acting Career</strong></h2><p>From 2009 to 2013, the young artist worked on numerous projects as a singer and actor, but he was not happy with his career. His unhappiness with his work life led him to explore more career opportunities. First, he decided to move to New York, America but later finalized to go to London for further studies.</p><p>He went there with the expectation of finding something new and more meaningful. Life in London was not a bed of roses for him; he was there alone and, on top of that, did not know his native language. According to his interview with&nbsp;Gakumado, his study in the UK lasted for 6 months, but he stayed away from acting for 2 years, realizing that he was born for acting and that being an actor was best for him.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Sakurada Dori during a music concert" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sakurada-Dori-during-a-music-concert.jpg alt="Sakurada Dori during a music concert" width=400 height=315 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>His time in England made him more dedicated to his profession and changed his attitude.
