Her parents divorced when she was five years old. Chamberlain was a member of her high school’s cheerleading and track team and took part in competitive cheer for five years.</p><p id=par-4_42>Chamberlain started making YouTube videos after her father told her to find an activity outside of school that she was passionate about. The <a href=#>YouTube sensation</a> said she’d been feeling very dissatisfied with school, and her father’s advice came at the right time.</p><p id=par-5_34>Then, the teenager started making videos using editing styles defined by zooms. With her father, who is a photographer and artist, Chamberlain was able to create fun videos detailing various aspects of her life.</p><p id=par-6_49>In 2017, she made a viral video doing a Dollar Store haul. Haul videos were trendy at the time, so the video got a lot of traction. Chamberlain started gaining more followers. Her parents soon realized she had potential and supported her choice to drop out of high school.</p><p id=par-7_57>Chamberlain moved to LA and focused on her budding career full-time. She currently stands at an impressive 11 million <a href=#>YouTube subscribers</a> and 15 million Instagram followers. The star has a high social media engagement rate that even surpasses social media queen Kim Kardashian’s. Chamberlain’s YouTube revenue and brand endorsements have earned her a <a href=#>$3 million net worth</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emma-chamberlain-is-a-retired-vegan>Emma Chamberlain is a retired vegan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_36>For years, Chamberlain has documented her diet. Those who’ve followed her for a long time know that she’s been meatless for a while. Chamberlain recently sat down with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper’s Bazaar</a> to discuss everything she eats daily.</p><p id=par-9_54>The internet personality revealed she is a vegetarian. She said, “I was vegan for a while but I’m vegetarian. Because I grew up vegetarian, I’ve never had meat in my diet.” Chamberlain notes that she continues with the diet because she is a picky eater. She also shared her disinterest in trying new meat.</p><p id=par-10_46>In 2018, Chamberlain once filmed a video alongside her Sister Squad mate Ethan Dolan where she tried new meat. In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Youtube</a> video, “Vegetarian Tries Meat For The First Time,” Dolan tried to get her to eat chicken burgers and steak, and she wasn’t a fan.</p><p id=par-11_50>Chamberlain was raised on a vegetarian diet, which perhaps explains why she has no particular interest in eating meat. She also revealed in the interview that coffee is a staple in her diet. The 22-year-old said she loves well-cooked eggs and cheese, although she admitted it doesn’t agree with her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chamberlain-s-workout-routine>Chamberlain’s workout routine</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOAwYWUOnxE</p></figure><p id=par-12_26>Chamberlain has detailed her workout routine in many of her videos, most of them being from 2020’s lockdown.
