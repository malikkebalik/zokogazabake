Peter Quill’s mother actually curated the <a href=#>Guardians of the Galaxy</a> playlist. Before dying, this character gifted her son with a mixtape of her favorite songs. That became the official “awesome mix” soundtrack, eventually added to music platforms like Spotify.</p><p id=par-3_46>“She’s a music lover, but she’s completely not elitist,” director James Gunn said during an interview with <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. “If it’s something that’s thought of as goofy and pop, she likes it. If it’s cool or funk, she likes it. She just likes hooks and melodies.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_42>“She’s a very quirky, young girl who fell in love with, you know, as it ends up, an alien,” he added. “And falling in love with an alien is right up there in Meredith Quill’s alley. She’s an oddball, like her son.”</p><p id=par-5_58>While these 70s-themed songs tell the story of Peter and Meredith’s relationship, they also help tell the Guardians of the Galaxy story. While searching for the “orb,” Peter Quill danced along to “Come And Get Your Love” by Redbone. In his “dance-off” to save the universe, this character belted out the lyrics to “O-o-h Child” by Five Stairsteps.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>‘Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout’ features six new songs</h2><p id=par-6_45>As a reimagined version of Tower of Terror, Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout was one of the first Marvel additions to Disney California Adventure in Disneyland.
