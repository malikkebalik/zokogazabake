Paul Michael London (known also by his ring name Sydistiko) was born April 16, 1980 in Austin, Texas. He is best known for his association with the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). London was trained at the Texas Wrestling Academy before competing for the Ring of Honor where his high-risk offensive moves made him a crowd favorite. He later competed for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Zero-One and independent promotions, winning multiple championships as well as the ECWA Super 8 Tournament in 2003. London made his debut in WWE in late 2003 where he was teamed with fellow cruiserweight Billy Kidman. After Kidman retired from active competition, London formed a tag team with <a href=# title="Brian Kendrick Net Worth">Brian Kendrick</a>, with whom he won the WWE Tag Team Championship.</p><p>London began competing in the cruiserweight division after his split with Kendrick and took home the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. In late 2006, Kendrick returned and the two reformed as a team. London and Kendrick then won the WWE Tag Team Championship, becoming the longest reigning WWE Tag Team Champions since the title's creation and the World Tag Team Championship at the time. Kendrick was then drafted to the SmackDown brand in June 2008 and London was released later that year. In 2009, Paul Michael London (aka Sydistiko) returned to the independent circuit, competing for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, where he was one half of the former PWG World Tag Team Champions with partner El Generico, under the team name Â¡Peligro Abejas!. In 1996, London's older brother Daniel was killed by a drunk driver at the age of nineteen. Paul Michael London has reportedly been romantically linked to former WWE Diva Ashley Massaro.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkxLOx0q2jnqqjZMC6sMisq6Kjn2K7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
