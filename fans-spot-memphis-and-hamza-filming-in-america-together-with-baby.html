After months of video calls and texts, Hamza proposed to Memphis without ever seeing her in person.</p><p id=par-3_50>She said yes and planned a two-week-long trip to meet Hamza for the first time in Tunisia. After meeting for the first time, the pair had issues communicating due to the <a href=#>language barrier and cultural differences</a>. However, they still <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in a two-day traditional Tunisian wedding celebration.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_50>And it appears that the wedding celebration was legit and legal. Records viewed by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">InTouch</a>&nbsp;confirm that Memphis is married. She changed her name, adding Hamza’s last name, ‘Mokni,’ to hers. According to the outlet, Memphis registered to vote in Ottawa County, Michigan, in October 2021 under the name Memphis Chardell-Arden Mokni.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-90-day-fianc-fans-spot-hamza-and-memphis-in-america>’90 Day Fiancé’ fans spot Hamza and Memphis in America</h2><p id=par-5_33>So what happens when Memphis goes home to Michigan?

One fan commented on a TikTok from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@thesarahfrasershow</a> (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@truecrime_jankie</a>), “Yes! She lives in my town. Seen him and the baby! :) they are shooting in Muskegon right now with 90 day camera crew.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-memphis-confims-she-had-a-baby>Memphis confims she had a baby</h2><p id=par-7_49>Since January 2022, rumors began circulating that <a href=#>Memphis was pregnant with Hamza’s baby</a> and that she had recently given birth. It started on January 9, when Memphis’ alleged ex-boyfriend went to <a href=#>Twitter</a> and wrote, “[Memphis] was pregnant with his baby she had the baby a few months ago.”</p><p id=par-8_56>On March 25, Memphis seemingly confirmed rumors when she posted a <a href=#>picture of a baby on her Instagram</a>.

If this Instagram photo of Memphis’ baby is current, the baby would have been born around November or December 2021, which aligns with Memphis’s ex’s timeline.</p><p id=par-10_33>It could be possible that Memphis and Hamza will appear on 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?
