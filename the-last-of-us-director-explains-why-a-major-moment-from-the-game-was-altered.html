Indeed, we are once again wondering why The Last of Us was ever a game to begin with, given that HBO has proven just what the property is capable of when presented to us on a medium that was actually designed for storytelling.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Game or no game, one advantage of any adaptation is the opportunity to improve upon the material, and the creative team behind The Last of Us did so in a big way this time around. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, “Kin” director Jasmila Žbanić explained the reasoning for changing the nuances surrounding Joel’s dangerous wound near the end of the episode.</p><p>“I got it in the script, and I really liked it because it was more subtle. Ellie thinks they made it, and then it’s a shock. Otherwise it would be immediately over. I really liked how Craig wrote it. They travel, she’s hopeful, they go on together — and then it’s a shock.”</p><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>In the game, Joel receives his injuries by falling off a balcony and getting impaled on a piece of metal, but the show sees him get stabbed by one of the raiders as he and Ellie attempt their escape from the abandoned Firefly base; a realization they don’t come to until after Joel successfully kills the attacker. Like Žbanić alluded to, it was conducive to a much more dramatic ebb and flow than we got in the game, especially given Joel’s character development earlier in the episode.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>The Last of Us is available to stream on HBO Max, with new episodes releasing every Sunday until the season’s conclusion on March 12. A second season <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been announced</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmo5qrpGK8p3nUrGSdoaKasLW70Wacsaiclravv4ywn7JlkWK6orbOq2Smp52au7V5xaumpmWknbJus8CmnGavkah6orjTnqmenF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
