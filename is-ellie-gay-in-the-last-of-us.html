With Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey in the two lead roles, there’s plenty of speculation and discussion on just how faithful The Last of Us series will be to the source material.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>Ramsey portrays Ellie in the HBO Max series, and one of the biggest questions surrounding her character in the series will be her sexuality.</p><h2 id=h-is-ellie-gay data-injectable=false>Is Ellie gay?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bella-ramsey-the-last-of-us.png><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Ellie was a groundbreaking character for many reasons in The Last of Us. The writing behind her character, the immense survivor’s guilt she feels, and attachment issues made her more than the fairly typical video game protagonist. Portrayed by Ashley Johnson in the games, she quickly became an “it girl” for gaming in the early 2010s.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In The Last of Us duology and downloadable content</a>, Ellie is openly gay with her sharing a kiss with Riley. When her character was confirmed to be queer, it was deemed a landmark moment for representation in gaming media, with gay characters typically not leads and rarely included in triple-A games.</p><p data-characters=854 data-current-count=854 data-injectable=true>With Neil Druckmann, who was behind the games, a major creative force for the HBO Max adaptation, it’s unsurprising that The Last of Us took the plunge and did in fact make Ellie canonically gay. In the seventh episode, aptly titled “Left Behind,” the same scenes play out almost identically from the DLC to the small screen; Riley brings Ellie to an abandoned mall in Boston, where she reveals that she’s joined the Fireflies and will be getting relocated to another base camp. While inside the mall, Ellie and Riley ride the carousel and play Mortal Kombat II, eventually ending up at the Halloween store — which gamers will recognize as the area used for the infamous water gun fight. Once Ellie and Riley dance for a little while, Ellie slows the tempo of the moment to beg Riley to stay, sharing an intimate kiss with her.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>In the previous episode, “Kin,” viewers are also convinced that Dina — Ellie’s girlfriend in The Last of Us: Part II — had been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">subtly inserted</a> as a mysterious character watching Ellie from afar, so it looks to be confirmed (near enough) that Dina will be coming in the second season.</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Interestingly, Ramsey, who portrays Ellie in the HBO series, is non-binary and uses any and all pronouns.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=107 data-injectable=false>The Last of Us is available to play on PlayStation, while the series is available exclusively from HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yeo6WhlWK0osWMoqVmrJiaeq2t0q1kqJ5dqsBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
