This musician actually revealed that he got his first tattoo at 12 years old — even though his mother thought he was joking at the time.</p><h2>J Balvin got his first tattoo at only 12 years old</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/J-Balvin-2.jpg><p id=par-2_56>J Balvin is the artist behind “LA CANCIÓN,” “UN PESO,” “Mi Gente,” and “QUE PRETENDES.” He’s also <a href=#>a songwriter</a> known for his tattoos, which cover his arms and other parts of his body. During one 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ</a>, J Balvin shared that, like fashion and music, he thinks tattoos “tell something about who you are.”</p><p id=par-3_47>“My first tattoo was when I was 12 — I actually asked my mom,” J Balvin said during the same interview. “I was like, ‘yo mom, I wanna get a tattoo.’ And she thought I was joking. She said, ‘yeah, yeah, go ahead.’ and I went ‘ok.’”</p><p id=par-4_53>It was a tribal pattern, although the artist has since covered up the original ink. The artist added that if he had a son, even at 12 years old, he would help him choose the right tattoo. (Now, J Balvin is a father, announcing the birth of his son, Rio, in June 2021.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>J Balvin shared some inspiration behind his tattoos</h2><p id=par-5_42>J Balvin’s biggest tattoo has smaller pictures within the bigger image, including a woman, a dollar, poker cards, and a microphone. On his knuckles are the letters that spell “vida,” which means life. There are also several tigers on this songwriter’s arms.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_63>“Tigers are my favorite animals. I have this tiger here, I have this tiger here…,” J Balvin said, pointing at different tattoos. “When I went to Thailand, I got the opportunity to share a little bit of the culture and watch a lot of tigers, and I just, like, I fell in love with them. How powerful and smart, and beautiful they are.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-j-balvin-revealed-where-he-thinks-is-the-most-painful-tattoo-spot>J Balvin revealed where he thinks is the most painful tattoo spot</h2><p id=par-7_64>J Balvin said that because he wanted to do something different, he got a Mickey Mouse that looks similar to a skull. There’s a flower on the back of his hand and a woman from Google on his arm. J Balvin added that he has his sister, Carolina, tattooed on his arm, saying, “she’s not, like, real expressive, but I think she loves it.”</p><p id=par-8_40>Where is the most painful spot to get a tattoo? According to J Balvin, that’s “definitely” the ribs or the back of someone’s hand. There is the Nirvana logo on J Balvin’s leg, which he revealed also hurt “like crazy.”</p><p id=par-9_37>In honor of his chart-topping song “Mi Gente,” this artist has “Mi Gente” tattooed on his body. This song currently has over a billion Spotify plays, with most <a href=#>music</a> by J Balvin available on major streaming platforms.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3bq7Apa2ipl1mwLV505qrraefYn5zeceeqZ6rXam8tr6MrKCnn5WnwG6uzp2wZqGeoHupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
