The first transaction occurred back in 2002 when Billy paid $22.5 million for his first 14 acres of what became 26 waterfront acres.</p><p>Back in 2002 Middlesea's primary mansion spanned 14,000 square feet. After a few upgrades and additions, today that primary mansion is 20,000 square feet. Though potential buyers should be aware that the mansion is actually in the middle of a renovation right now. <a href=#>Billy's realtor told the Wall Street Journal</a> that he decided to list the property mid-reno because "whoever buys will want to do their own selections of how to paint and decorate and perhaps style the kitchen."</p><p>In addition to the 20,000 square-foot primary mansion, Middlesea also features a multi-room beach house, floating dock, two pools and helipad for easy access from your Manhattan apartment or your private local private airport.</p><p>Here's a video tour of Middlesea in all of its glory:</p><p></p><h2><strong>"Realtor to the Stars"</strong></h2><p>Billy Joel has owned a bunch of homes in NYC and on Long Island over the years, and he has a surprising track record of selling his properties to other celebrities. To the point where he once jokingly referred to himself as the "realtor to the stars."</p><p>For example, in 2000, Billy sold his enormous oceanfront estate in Amagansett, New York, to <a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld</a> for a then-record $32 million. He also sold a duplex apartment in Manhattan to the singer <a href=#>Sting</a>.</p><p>Maybe a celebrity will purchase Middlesea!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeZonquu9WipWanpal6o7XLpbBmop%2BauW6%2FxJ6irGVkbnqutculoKimXZu8s3mRb2Sam6Kaerit056pn6qfo8FutdKlmKecXZi8rrzOrqWdZaeewal5x56joqiRmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
