During his high school years, Shumpert played on the same basketball team as Evan Turner. As a teen, Iman became a first team all-state player and reached three conference titles. He then made it into the top 15 of all ranked senior players in the nation. While in high school, Iman also displayed a passion for Spoken Word poetry.</p><p>After graduating, Iman attended Georgia Tech. While playing for the school's basketball team, he became the fourth-leading scorer for the 2008-2009 season. A knee injury caused him to miss six games next season, but he bounced back in the 2010-2011 season to lead his team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. After breaking Georgia Tech's record for steals per game, Shumpert declared himself eligible for the NBA draft in 2011.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Shumpert began his NBA career with the New York Knicks but suffered a number of knee injuries early on and missed the rest of his first season. In 2013, he returned to practices, only to suffer another shoulder injury in 2014 that ruled him out for three weeks. Iman was then traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2015 and started strong with his new team, helping them reach the 2015 NBA Finals later that year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-178519 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Iman-Shumpert1.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-178519 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><p>After signing a $40-million contract extension with the Cavaliers, Iman suffered another injury – this time it was his wrist.
