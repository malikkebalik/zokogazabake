Rocky moved to Toronto from Nova Scotia at the age of 16 to pursue his own dreams of becoming a wrestler. It was this move that began his relationship with Ata.</p><p id=par-3_65>Ata’s father was Grand Chief Peter Maivia. He was a wrestler and eventually built the Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling (PPW), alongside his wife Lia Maivia. As fate would have it, the Grand Chief and Rocky ended up partnering together within the independent wrestling scene. Rocky met Ata and they married in 1970, against her father’s wishes. <a href=#>Dwayne</a> was born soon after, on May 2, 1972.</p><p id=par-4_71>With Rocky pursuing his wrestling career, the family moved around a lot. They were happy, but there were troubles for everyone with all the moving around. They were evicted from a home in Honolulu because they couldn’t afford to pay. However, eventually, they settled in Miami where Dwayne played football in college until sustaining a back injury. He studied hard after a bout with depression, graduating with a degree in criminology.</p><p id=par-5_53>Due to a previous marriage before marrying Ata, Rocky had two other <a href=#>children</a> before he moved to Canada. He had a son Curtis Bowles and a daughter Wanda Bowles, Dwayne’s half-brother and half-sister. Ata and Rocky never had more children beyond Dwayne. The Rock’s parents divorced in 2003 after being married 30 years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-johnson-had-a-close-but-complicated-relationship-with-his-father>Johnson had a close but complicated relationship with his father</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_26>On <a href=#>Jan. 15, 2020</a>, Hall of Famer Rocky Johnson died due to a pulmonary embolism that caused a heart attack.
