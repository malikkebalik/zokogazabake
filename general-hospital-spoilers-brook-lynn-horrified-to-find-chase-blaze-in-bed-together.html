Will Brook Lynn fix her detective mistake too late and fear Chase has moved on?</p><p>GH fans know Chase was furious when Brook Lynn broke his trust and put her selfish desires above his own.</p><p>Chase enjoyed growing closer to Brook Lynn through their popstar project, but music just isn’t his passion.</p><p>There’s nothing Chase wanted more than to be a cop again – and Brook Lynn had the power to help with a letter explaining the context behind his thrown punches.</p><p>It could’ve gone a long way toward proving Chase was a good guy who always sought justice, even if he made a couple of impulsive bad decisions.</p><p>Unfortunately, Brook Lynn didn’t finish that letter in time to send it to the civilian complaint review board meeting.</p><p>Now Chase’s appeal has been denied, so he’s trying to accept that he’ll never be a cop ever again.</p><p>Brook Lynn, on the other hand, refuses to accept the fight is over. We know that Brook Lynn is determined to fix this somehow and has called in a mysterious favor to make it happen.</p><p>There’s a good chance Brook Lynn’s mission will pay off, so Chase may be reinstated after all.</p><p>Alas, Brook Lynn’s plan may not have the happy ending she’s hoping for – at least not at first.</p><p>For starters, Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) already suggested that Chase wouldn’t like it if she went behind his back to pull strings.</p><p>We’d say Dante may be right about that, so Chase might lash out over Brook Lynn once again keeping secrets and trying to do things her way.</p><p>However, the bigger problem could come in the form of another woman.</p><p>Chase had some sweet bonding scenes with Sasha Gilmore (Sofia Mattsson) recently, but those scenes appeared to be genuinely friendly and offered no real romantic hints.</p><p>Sasha is still grieving for Brando Corbin (Johnny Wactor), so it’d be better to pair Chase up with someone else – especially if this is just going to be a brief fling.</p><p>There’s surely a reason why Chase and Blaze have been connecting during their duet preparation.</p><p>Even Linc Brown (Dan Buran) commented on how his stars were getting along and could see the chemistry.</p><p>It seems likely GH writers will put that chemistry to good use and have Chase land in bed with Blaze.</p><p>They could hook up at Chase’s apartment or perhaps take their sizzling sparks back to Blaze’s hotel room if she’s got one at the Metro Court.</p><p>Regardless, this situation is just begging for Brook Lynn to show up with updates on Chase being reinstated – only to discover him in a passionate moment with Blaze.</p><p>Chase is single and free to do whatever he wants, but the thought of him with someone else will sting for Brook Lynn.</p><p>That’s particularly true since the breakup is so recent and Brook Lynn has been working so hard to undo the damage.</p><p>Will Brook Lynn fix her detective mistake and make Chase a cop again? Will it happen too late to stop Chase from hooking up with Blaze?</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say Brook Lynn may have good news for Chase, but she seems poised to face another crushing blow herself!</p><p>CDL’s the place to be for the hottest <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so visit us often.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ybqainm2K5urrNZp%2BoqqKes6qxw2arqGWWnrulecKhmKydXZe5osbEZqCnZZKasW7AzqCcraCVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
