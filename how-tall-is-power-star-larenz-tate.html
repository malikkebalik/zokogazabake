While his dark side wasn’t focused on much on the show, fans weren’t surprised at all whenever it came out.</p><p id=par-2_57>The actor who brings the character of Rashad to life is none other than <a href=#>Larenz Tate</a>. He is an extremely talented actor who’s been involved in other successful works before. Interestingly, he is the shortest of the male actors on the set of the hit crime drama show. Find out how tall Tate is in real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Larenz-Tate.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-larenz-tate-has-been-in-successful-filmography-before>Larenz <strong>Tate has been in successful filmography before</strong></h2><p id=par-3_52>Tate is <a href=#>one-third of a trio of siblings</a> who also work in Hollywood. When they were younger, their parents enrolled them in a drama program at the Inner-City Cultural Center. However, the brothers didn’t take the classes seriously until one of their classmates became famous after being cast on The Cosby Show.</p><p id=par-4_54>Tate then appeared in The New Twilight Zone and graduated from Palmdale High School in 1993. He followed that with cameos in shows such as The Wonder Years and 21 Jump Street. He then got cast as Willie Fuffner in Family Matters and starred alongside Della Reese and Redd Foxx in The Royal Family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_48>In the early ’90s, Tate began getting offers to star in films such as Menace II Society, The Inkwell, and Dead Presidents. Tate also had a guest role on the hit sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air playing Kenny in the episode That’s No Lady, That’s My Cousin.</p><p id=par-6_68>Tate followed that up with appearances in The Postman, Why Do Fools Fall in Love, Biker Boys alongside Laurence Fishburne, Man Apart, and played Quincy Jones in the 2004 film Ray.

He, however, can turn on people, and as Tate himself puts it, “he is ready to kill your family if he has to.”</p><p id=par-8_41>Rashad has a penchant for dirty deeds, is elusive, and always avoids getting caught. He knows how to pull all the strings in politics to work in his favor, understands how the streets work and what people want in a leader.</p><p id=par-9_54>Rashad might be a shady politician, but he has a soft spot for his family. He has shown that he can go to any lengths to protect his family and would never sell them out at any cost. When Tate accepted Rashad’s role, he wanted to make sure his character wasn’t a generic villain.</p><p id=par-10_53>Tate wanted Rashad to be a multifaceted character and criminal. This is why the Councilman usually looks well-polished and classy but shady. Rumors of an <a href=#>upcoming spinoff</a> featuring Rashad have been swirling for some time now. The spinoff will probably give fans more information and background about what makes the formidable politician tick.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-tall-is-larenz-tate><strong>How tall is Larenz Tate?</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/LarenzTate/status/1215409574015987713?s=20</p></figure><p id=par-11_88>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Express</a>, the Power star stands at 1.7 m, equivalent to 5ft 5in making him the shortest male actor out of the show’s main cast.
