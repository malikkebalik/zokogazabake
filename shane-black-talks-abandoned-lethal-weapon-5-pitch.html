It was interesting. It was essentially an older Riggs and Murtagh in New York City during the worst blizzard in east coast history, fighting a team of expert Blackwater guys from Afghanistan that’s smuggling antiquities. And we had a young character that actually counter-pointed them. But I didn’t wanna do what people do when they’re trying to transition which is, they sorta put the two older guys in the movie, but really it’s about their son! And he’s gonna take over and we’re gonna do a spinoff. Fuck that, if they’re gonna be in the movie, they’re gonna be in the movie — I don’t care how old they are.”</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>It’s good to hear that Black wouldn’t cave to the widely accepted, industry-wide practice of introducing a next-generation cast to ensure the&nbsp;Lethal Weapon brand could surpass the involvement of its original stars. Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover)&nbsp;are the spirit of&nbsp;Lethal Weapon, and no one knows that better than the writer who brought them both to life as one of cinema’s most consistently badass, incessantly bantering duos.</p><p data-characters=708 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=false>Also of note: that pitch indicates that Black would have approached a fifth&nbsp;installment as another Christmas movie, which is definitely good news for anyone who’s followed the writer-director’s career path –&nbsp;thrillers set around the holidays appear to be his strong suit. Alas, it doesn’t seem like&nbsp;<strong>Lethal Weapon 5 </strong>will ever happen – the fourth installment sparked less audience interest than any previous entry in the franchise, and it’s dubious whether Gibson and Glover would ever reprise their roles. Luckily, if you’re in the mood for another set of&nbsp;fast-talking, quip-ready dudes written by Black,&nbsp;The Nice Guys, at least for this summer, has you covered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqGZnpp6o7jAnKJmrJGhuLR5wJuYp5yfo7Klecueq6GZnGLEpq3PqKVmbV2ltrWvx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
