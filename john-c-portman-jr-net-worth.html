John Portman was known for his office and hotel designs of multi-structured interior atria. Portman was born in Walhalla, South Carolina, USA on December 4, 1924. He grew up in Atlanta, joined the Navy and served in World War II. In 1950, Portman graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in architecture. PortmanÂ´s portfolio includes a series of projects across many US cities and countries. His first atrium hotel was the Hyatt Regency Atlanta. This project led to other major iconic projects such as the Westin Bonaventure Hotel at Los Angeles and the Renaissance Center at Detroit, considered the tallest hotel within the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>In 1990, Portman developed the Shanghai Center, which was his first of numerous key projects within China and other continents in Asia. His style of design is known for being "cinematic" and relating interior design and elements to the individual. Portman designed many buildings in Atlanta and is considered to have a large impact on the cityscape. Within the state of Georgia but outside of Atlanta, Portman's most famous project is his own beach house, Entelechy II in Sea Island. This beach house also became an art museum to portray PortmanÂ´s pieces of art. In 2009, PortmanÂ´s work was displayed in AtlantaÂ´s High Museum of Art. The success of Portman and his reputation is due to his clever combination of architecture and design.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wp6mrGeapLWvecJmp6iqpKKur3nJq2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
