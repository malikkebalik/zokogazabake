Contestants were challenged to endure hunger, below-freezing temperatures, and the looming threat of animal attack. The goal? Push themselves to the absolute limit and prove who could last the longest in the wilderness.</p><p id=par-2_36>Ultimately, winner Juan Pablo Quiñonez survived independently for 78 days. Where is he and the rest of the Alone Season 9 cast now? Let’s take a look at what the top five&nbsp;<a href=#>Alone&nbsp;Season 9 contestants</a>&nbsp;are doing now.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-juan-pablo-quinonez-from-alone-season-9-doing-now>What is Juan Pablo Quiñonez from ‘Alone’ Season 9 doing now?</h2><p id=par-3_47><a href=#>Juan Pablo Quiñonez from Pinawa, Manitoba</a>, Canada, won&nbsp;Alone&nbsp;Season 9, proving his resilience by lasting a milestone 78 days in the lower reaches of the Big River in Northern Labrador, Canada. He lasted three days longer than the closest of his fellow competitors, second-place finisher Karie Lee Knoke.</p><p id=par-4_71>Quiñonez grew up in Mexico, where he spent time in the forest trapping rattlesnakes, scorpions, and lizards.&nbsp;Since competing in Alone, the survival specialist completed a book he began working on in 2020. Quiñonez celebrated the release of his book,&nbsp;Thrive: Long-Term Wilderness Survival Guide, to his followers on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;on July 13, 2022. He can now add author to his list of professions, which also includes being an outdoor professional and wilderness first responder.</p><p id=par-5_40>In 2023, Quiñonez began sharing images of construction on a tiny home. The Alone Season 9 winner indicated plans to place the homestead on a remote piece of property in Canada. He also confirmed he’s engaged to his girlfriend Jennier.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2>Where is Karie Lee Knoke from ‘Alone’ Season 9 now?</h2><p id=par-6_68>Karie Lee Knoke from Sandpoint, Idaho, was the runner-up of&nbsp;Alone&nbsp;Season 9, lasting 75 days in Labrador, Canada. With just two remaining survivalists in the competition and the race to the finish line intensifying, Knoke seemed to be on the verge of becoming the first-ever female winner of Alone. Unfortunately, limited food sources and rough weather — including Labrador’s harsh snowstorms — eventually forced her to tap out.</p><p id=par-7_63>Since competing in Alone, Karie has continued to teach wilderness and primitive living skills around the country. She still lives off-grid in a yurt, which she has called home for 23 years. The survivalist also runs Sacred Cedars Wilderness School at the base of the Selkirk Mountains in North Idaho. The school also offers online courses teaching cooking, survival, and crafting skills.</p><p id=par-8_66>According to Karie Lee’s website, she runs “week-long immersion expeditions into the wilderness.” She also works as a pesticide research scientist, collecting data for publication in scientific journals on pesticide toxicity. Karie Lee has an informative&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>&nbsp;channel where viewers can find more behind-the-scenes knowledge about her time on&nbsp;Alone. She’s also writing a book, The Art of Sacred Living, which is due out by the end of 2023.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>What is Teimojin Tan from the ‘Alone’ Season 9 cast doing now?</h2><p id=par-9_45>Teimojin Tan competed in&nbsp;Alone&nbsp;Season 9 for 63 days before he tapped out because he missed his family, placing him in third place.

His next endeavor after competing in Alone was an attempt to traverse the length of the Northwest Passage.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_56>In the summer of 2023, Adam and fellow survivalist, Matty Clarke, planned to row the great wilderness of the Northwest Passage. He shared updates on his journey on his social media, and while it didn’t end the way he had hoped due to a critical gear failure, he still felt it was a worthwhile challenge.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><h2>What is Jessie Krebs doing now?</h2><p id=par-14_61>Jessie Krebs from Pagosa Springs, Colorado, survived for 46 days in&nbsp;Alone&nbsp;Season 9 before the medical team evacuated her due to stomach inflammation.

The name of her school stands for Outdoorsy Women Learning Survival Skills. She hosts beginner courses like Women Survival Weekends as well as online courses.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_37>Her dream for the school is to empower and support women in learning the wilderness survival skills often reserved and passed down by men.&nbsp;She also shares survival tips and advice in her column for Backpacker Magazine,</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-5><p></p></figure><p id=par-16_6>Background information from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The History Channel</a>&nbsp;cast page.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_50>Alone&nbsp;Seasons 1 through 10 are available for streaming via The History Channel.
