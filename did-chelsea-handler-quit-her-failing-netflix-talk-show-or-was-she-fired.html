This week, the feelgood story is Chelsea Handler’s nastiness being rewarded with a pink slip. A few weeks ago, Netflix <a href=#>released some information about Handler’s sad talk show</a> – the show was and is bombing with audiences to the point where Netflix was drastically reducing the number of shows they produce with Chelsea. Audiences don’t give a sh-t about her, and it’s always been (in my mind) an “emperor’s new clothes” situation – I honestly never understood why anyone thought Handler would be able to generate interest or her own audience at Netflix. She’s awful. Well, guess what? Netflix canceled Handler’s show. And now she’s trying to play it like she’s the one who decided to end her show, so she could focus more on her political activism.</p><p>Chelsea Handler’s Netflix talk show “Chelsea” is ending after two seasons.</p><p>Handler tweeted the news on Wednesday, saying it was her decision to not return for another season. In a statement posted online, she wrote, “Like so many across the country, the past presidential election and the countless events that have unfolded since have galvanized me. From the national level down to the grassroots, it’s clear our decisions at the ballot box next year will mark a defining moment for our nation. For these reasons, I’ve decided not to return for another season of Chelsea, and instead devote as much time as I can to becoming a more knowledgeable and engaged citizen and to focus on projects that have significance to me.”</p><p>“I’m excited to share that I will continue my partnership with Netflix, working together on a documentary where I’ll engage with people I don’t talk with enough – people of different ethnicities, religions and political philosophies,” she continued. “Netflix could not be more understanding, and I’m grateful for their continued support. New episodes of Chelsea will continue to stream weekly until the end of this year.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>Do you believe her? I do not. The only thing is… Deplorables hate her too, so of course they’re celebrating and making this into a “liberal comedian gets fired for being anti-Trump” story. Which… isn’t the case, in my opinion. It’s not that Handler has liberal politics – it’s that no one gave a sh-t about her liberal politics, and she was not an effective spokesperson for any particular progressive cause, nor was she particularly funny, woke, talented or smart. <a href=#>One source on Twitter</a> claimed “Chelsea Handler’s show cancellation was NOT her choice. She’s lying! She found out today and she was ‘totally blindsided’.” That would not surprise me, even though that source is questionable.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/X4zEJXeDQY</a></p><p>— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) <a href=#>October 18, 2017</a></p><p><a id=Izks_BA7SkJzrSUd84Cbyw class=gie-single href=#>Embed from Getty Images</a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Getty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbm1kZoF4e8Oim5ibmJq5tLHAmJ%2BappShsrOr0K6grZeYmr%2BgssCio6Kml5S7psDFpaCxl6SWuayr0qGmsJefp6y4rdKYqqGdj5u2s7HDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
