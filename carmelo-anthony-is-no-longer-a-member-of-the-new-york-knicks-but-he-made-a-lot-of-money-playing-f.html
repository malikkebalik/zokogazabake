But He Made A LOT Of Money Playing F</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><span style=font-weight:400>Last year, after <a href=# rel=noopener>Kevin Durant</a> left for the Golden State Warriors, it looked like the Thunder might be headed towards a complete rebuild. Instead, <a href=# rel=noopener>Russell Westbrook</a> signed an extension, he won MVP, and the Thunder clawed their way to a 6-seed in the playoffs.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, the Thunder are hungry for more and are putting together quite the offseason. They've already nabbed <a href=# rel=noopener>Paul George</a> from the Pacers, and they just acquired <a href=# rel=noopener>Carmelo Anthony</a> in a trade with the New York Knicks. The Thunder will send <a href=# title="Enes Kanter Net Worth">Enes Kanter</a>, Doug McDermott, and a second-round pick (via the Bulls) in exchange for Anthony.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To allow the deal to actually happen, Anthony waived his no-trade clause and $8.1 million trade kicker. The no-trade clause will follow him to the Thunder, who were one of three teams – the other being the Cleveland Cavaliers and Houston Rockets – for which Anthony would waive his no-trade clause.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Thunder will absorb a $27.8 million luxury tax penalty this season as their payroll rises to $134 million. Anthony still has two years and $54 million left on his deal, which includes a player option for $27.9 million during the 2018-19 campaign.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-233116 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-667847096.jpg alt width=900 height=679 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-233116 class=wp-caption-text>Elsa/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The trade, of course, means Anthony's days as a Knick are over. And while the team may not have seen great success during his stay, he certainly made a ton of money.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Over the course of 2,404 days, Anthony earned $56,444 every single day he was a member of the Knicks. That's an average of $313,933 per game, for a grand total of $135.9 million. Not bad for a little more than six years of service.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Oklahoma City's odds to win the title jumped from 20-to-1 to 16-to-1 after landing Anthony, though their projected win total only increased one game, from 51.5 to 52.5.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Their window to win might be limited to this year – Westbrook has a five-year, $207 million extension waiting for him, with a deadline to sign by October 16. If the Thunder attempt to re-sign Westbrook, Anthony and George next offseason, their payroll and luxury tax could combine to reach $300 million. That's more than any NBA team has ever paid in one season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bringing in George and Anthony for what may be just one-year rental is a bold gamble. But these guys are still great players. Maybe a change of scenery is all they need to help bring home a championship.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpyYq6WVobxurc2tn6imqWK7sHnLqKWgnaJiuqa5wZ6pZqaVrHq6u9GkZKSmmZi4tHnMmpueZZykwW65zqecsmWgoa66tc2gZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
