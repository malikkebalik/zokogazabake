Off-screen, Chalamet is known to be just as loveable as he is on-screen. His down-to-earth personality and relatable nature have made him a favorite among fans, especially younger ones.</p><p id=cc9f3d75-668c-4f1d-99f0-d5fc1b3b6abf data-characters=106 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>So, if that includes you, and you are unabashedly a Chalamaniac, here’s everything you need to know.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Timotheé Chalamet’s filmography, so far</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Timothee-Chalamet-Dune-e1682627775639.jpg><p id=cc9f3d75-668c-4f1d-99f0-d5fc1b3b6abf data-characters=361 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Interstellar</a> paved the way for him to receive widespread attention and fame. He then found his way to the role of Elio Perlman, which catapulted him to the Academy Award stage. Chalamet flexed his acting chops in Call Me By Your Name as a young gay man in love with his father’s intern (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Armie Hammer</a>), and his career has only continued to soar ever since.</p><p id=cc9f3d75-668c-4f1d-99f0-d5fc1b3b6abf data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>The fourth-generation New Yorker then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">went on to star in various films</a> like Lady Bird, Beautiful Boy, and Little Women, cementing his status as one of Hollywood’s most in-demand actors. In 2021, Chalamet finally sealed his name as a Hollywood A-lister after starring in Denis Villeneuve’s successful adaptation of the 1965&nbsp;novel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune</a>. The film is set to receive a sequel, currently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to release on March 1, 2024</a>.</p><h2 id=h-how-tall-is-timothee-chalamet data-injectable=false>How tall is Timothée Chalamet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1347309304.jpg><p id=f5361863-4090-41ae-b040-bf23187dcc39 data-characters=470 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>According to Chalamet’s IMDb profile, he stands at an impressive 5 feet, 10 inches. However, some fans questioned the legitimacy of that when they saw photos of Chalamet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">standing beside his Dune co-star, Zendaya</a> at the UK Special Screening of the film. The actress and model is also reportedly 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and because most actresses typically show up to red-carpet events in high heels, it seemed odd that the two would be at eye level with each other.</p><p id=f5361863-4090-41ae-b040-bf23187dcc39 data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Of course, if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya</a> did wear heels, they were well hidden underneath her cream-colored dress. The accessory is notoriously uncomfortable, and red carpet events are notoriously long, so the Dune actress very well could have shown up in flats and none of us would’ve been the wiser, making Chalamet’s 5-foot-10 stature more plausible.</p><p id=f5361863-4090-41ae-b040-bf23187dcc39 data-characters=235 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>To set things straight, during past red carpet events where the pair posed side-by-side, Zendaya appeared noticeably taller than Chalamet, likely due to high heels. So, it’s fair to say that the actor is indeed 5 feet, 10 inches.</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-timothee-chalamet-and-when-is-his-birthday data-injectable=false>How old is Timothée Chalamet and when is his birthday?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1388057852.jpg><p id=f5361863-4090-41ae-b040-bf23187dcc39 data-characters=276 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Timothée Chalamet was born on December 27, 1995, making him 27 years old as of this writing. Chalamet is a Capricorn for those who adhere to zodiac signs, which means he’s ambitious and hard-working — two qualities that have certainly helped him succeed in Hollywood.</p><p id=f5361863-4090-41ae-b040-bf23187dcc39 data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>At just 27 years old, Chalamet has not only made a name for himself as an A-list actor but also as a fashion icon for the youth. His red-carpet appearances such as the 2022 Academy Awards ceremony, where he showed up shirtless, or almost shirtless <strong>—</strong> he tossed on a bedazzled blazer that covered up near to nothing, have kept him in the headlines praising his distinct fashion sense.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-timothee-chalamet-s-ethnicity data-injectable=false>What is Timothée Chalamet’s ethnicity?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1338741684.jpg><p id=091caaa8-8939-4a52-9a65-f93fd83b56f3 data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Raised in Hells Kitchen, New York</a>, Timothée Chalamet was born to Marc Chalamet, who works as an editor for the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and Nicole Flender, a performing artist and licensed real estate agent. His father is of French descent, having been born in Nîmes, France, while his mother is “Jewish, of Russian Jewish and Austrian Jewish descent,” according to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a> profile.</p><p id=091caaa8-8939-4a52-9a65-f93fd83b56f3 data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>That means, like many Americans, Chalamet has a mixed ethnic background including French, Russian Jewish, and Austrian Jewish descent.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=false>If you weren’t a Chalamaniac before, we wouldn’t be surprised if you are now. Either way now’s the best time to jump on the bandwagon because the future looks bright for the young actor. He is set to appear as the titular character in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul King’s upcoming film Wonka</a>, which will be released on Dec. 15, 2023. The Dune star is also currently the talk of the town for his alleged <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship with the famous American socialite Kylie Jenner</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG7AyKamraCVmnqktMClmKadpGK1pr7ErGShoaNitaa1xqGrZpmXmnqjtdGtn52ZqWKur7CMnquhppmYtrXFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
