In a tweet on April 15, show creator DJ Nash gave a teaser about the ending.</p><p id=par-10_33>“Yesterday, I finished writing the Season 3 finale to @AMillionABC,” Nash wrote on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. “Can’t wait for you all to see it. If you thought Eddie getting hit by a car was a cliffhanger..”</p><p id=par-11_32>Since viewers had no idea that Eddie would be struck by a car, we can’t predict what the new cliffhanger might be when the A Million Little Things Season 3 finale airs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-million-little-things-season-4-release-date><strong>‘A Million Little Things’ Season 4 release date</strong></h2><p id=par-12_62>The ABC drama isn’t renewed yet for season 4. However, the A Million Little Things Season 3 finale is a few weeks behind shows like&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Station 19. ABC announced the renewal of both the medical drama and firefighter drama on May 10, only two weeks before the season finales.&nbsp;A Million Little Things Season 3 finale is still weeks away, on June 9.</p><p id=par-13_55>From what Nash shared with followers, it is evident that he isn’t wrapping up the series. He plans to end season 3 on a cliffhanger, so he believes&nbsp;A Million Little Things&nbsp;Season 4 is coming. If ABC renews the series, it will premiere in September 2021. All&nbsp;A Million Little Things&nbsp;episodes are available for streaming on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSubrnIpaOip55iuarA06WcZqyYnruov4ysnJqrn6N6dHnFoqWapJVisq%2Bw0makmqujnsOmecKloJ%2BemJa7qLHRZ5%2BtpZxk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
