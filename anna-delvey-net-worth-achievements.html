It was in New York that Sorokin began to weave the intricate web of her persona as Anna Delvey, a wealthy German heiress with grand ambitions.</p><p>Her most notable career move, albeit infamous, was the conceptualization of the “Anna Delvey Foundation,” a proposed private members’ club and art foundation in New York.</p><p>She envisioned this as a multi-purpose venue encompassing an art studio, pop-up shops, and exhibition spaces for prominent artists.

Sorokin, posing as a wealthy heiress, made a name for herself in New York’s elite social circles.</p><p>Her notable endeavor was the conceptualization of the “Anna Delvey Foundation” (ADF), a proposed private members’ club and art foundation.</p><p>Despite her convincing portrayal and efforts, the ADF, which she claimed would be backed by a $60 million trust fund, was revealed to be part of a larger fraudulent scheme. As such, Anna Delvey’s “achievements” are more infamously linked to her scams rather than conventional awards or honors.</p><h2>Anna Delvey Net Worth</h2><p>Anna Delvey net worth is estimated to be $50,000. This figure is largely influenced by her legal history and her deal with Netflix.</p><p>Delvey’s initial wealth was acquired through fraudulent activities, specifically by creating the fictitious Anna Delvey Foundation. After her conviction for grand larceny, she served a prison sentence and was ordered to pay restitution to her victims.</p><p>A significant portion of her net worth comes from the $320,000 she received from Netflix for the rights to her story, which was adapted into the miniseries “Inventing Anna.”</p><p>She used a large part of this money to pay off her victims and legal fees. Her earnings are also supplemented by the sale of her artwork through her website and her social media influence, with over 1 million Instagram followers. However, a majority of her income is currently allocated to settling fines and legal obligations​</p><h2>Real Estate</h2><p>In the realm of real estate, Anna Delvey’s ambitions were grand. She had set her sights on the Church Missions House, a six-story building located at 281 Park Avenue South in New York.</p><p>This historic building, a landmark on the National Register of Historic Places in Gramercy Park, was intended to be the home for her Anna Delvey Foundation. Delvey claimed to have secured the lease for this 45,000 square feet space with the aid of a prestigious real-estate advisory company.</p><p>However, her plans for this elaborate space, which included visual arts centers, pop-up shops, and exhibitions, never materialized due to the revelation of her fraudulent activities. The building, known for its rich design and history, was later taken over by Fotografiska New York, a branch of the Swedish photography museum.</p><p>Anna Delvey net worth is estimated to be about $50,000 , this is inclusive of her wealth in real estate.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Regarding charity and philanthropic activities, Anna Delvey’s story is quite different from conventional philanthropists. Her involvement in charitable activities was deeply intertwined with her fraudulent schemes.</p><p>While she presented herself as a benefactor with intentions to support the arts and culture through the Anna Delvey Foundation, these claims were later exposed as part of her elaborate ruse to gain financial support and credibility in New York’s high society.</p><p>Consequently, any discussion of her charity work must be viewed through the lens of her overarching fraudulent activities and the lack of genuine philanthropic intent.</p><h2>Notable Anna Delvey’s Quotes</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthrector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Anna-q1.jpg alt width=1100 height=619 sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span style=font-size:inherit>Every day, men do far worse things than anything I’ve allegedly done.
