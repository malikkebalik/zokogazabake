It was hard playing that role," he said in an interview with GQ Magazine.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Bautista stars as the dopey, often socially unaware character alongside Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel in the movie.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He said the gruelling make-up process to transform him into the reformed intergalactic criminal "was beating me down".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"And I just don't know if I want Drax to be my legacy - it's a silly performance, and I want to do more dramatic stuff."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Before acting, Dave enjoyed a successful career with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), gaining fame under his ring name Batista.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/79E1/production/_128210213_gettyimages-672408278.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Bautista and Chris Pratt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Dave Bautista began acting in 2006 and has gone on to appear in films including Spectre, Blade Runner 2049 and Dune</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He also spoke about comparisons with Dwayne Johnson, aka the Rock - arguably the most successful wrestler turned actor.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He said it was never his intention to imitate The Rock, but said he does "just want to beâ€¦ a respected actor".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I'm nervous about things. But I can force myself to do things that make me uncomfortable, because I know I'm not going to get anywhere if I don't.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I may cringe after the fact, but I'm not going to let that fear hold me back," he told the US magazine.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Dave isn't alone in having a rather more bleak look back at a role that's given him and his fans so much.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">Moving on</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Robert Pattinson received lots of love for his career-making role as vampire Edward Cullen in Twilight.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But he said it was "weird being part of that, representing something you don't particularly like".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">James Bond himself - Daniel Craig - said in an interview after Spectre's 2015 release that he wanted to "move on" and would only do another 007 "for the money".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And he got it.

So that was never fully explored."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">She describes this as "a window" for Bautista to "explore new opportunities".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And his relief might be the ability to do that while no longer "feeling obligated to Marvel to stay in that role," Katie says.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Katie is also a Marvel fan and describes the franchise as one "that you grow up with and become emotionally invested in".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But she says the character of Drax is different to other notable names.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/C801/production/_128210215_gettyimages-670671554.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Dave Bautista" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Dave has made a successful transition from WWE wrestler to star actor</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Drax is one of those characters that fans can enjoy, but it's not as big an emotional investment as compared to Iron Man or Captain America."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And she feels the comments will help "build interest" in the film and Drax's future before the film comes out.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"What will be interesting is how his departure will affect the Guardians, as well as the future films."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Will the comic relief go towards other characters, or was this a missed opportunity to elevate his history?"</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"What we've learned from the MCU is that things can happen in the most unexpected of ways," she adds.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/179B9/production/_106279669_fb1c6c40-2f65-4fc3-9432-c4967c0d59c7.jpg.webp alt=line style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/E21D/production/_127058875_newsbeat2022websitefooter.jpg.webp alt="Newsbeat logo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">Follow Newsbeat on </i><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Twitter</a><i class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"> and </i><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">YouTube</a><i class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">.</i></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">Listen to Newsbeat </i><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">live</a><i class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"> at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back </i><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">here</a>.</p>BBC in other languages<span data-testid=level1NavText-/innovation class="sc-7be630a6-3 dyMECJ">Innovation</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o67CZ5qopV%2Bjsri%2FjqecsKuSmq61eZVtaG1vZGaA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
