Will GH writers make it so Valentin is a true Cassadine after all?</p><p>Valentin was initially devastated to learn he was Helena Cassadine’s (Constance Stowers) illegitimate son.</p><p>Valentin was nearly driven to suicide since his world was turned completely upside down.</p><p>Fortunately, Valentin came to grips with his non-Cassadine identity and has been trying to forge his own path ever since.</p><p>However, the show never answered the crucial question of who Valentin’s father actually is.</p><p>There’s a good chance the writing team didn’t even know back then! Stories often change and get rewritten as new possibilities come into focus.</p><p>Now that all roads lead to Victor Cassadine – and they’ve gone to the trouble of recasting the role for a major arc – Victor just might be the answer to the big father question.</p><p>Perhaps Valentin could be tied to the Cassadine family tree through a different branch than he previously thought.</p><p>Victor is obviously connected to Drew Cain’s (Cameron Mathison) time in captivity as well as the murder of Hayden Barnes’ (Rebecca Budig) mother, Naomi Dreyfus (Gigi Bermingham).</p><p>Victor’s also behind Liesl Obrecht’s (Kathleen Gati) kidnapping, so GH is making plenty of Victor connections lately.</p><p>In the September 13 episode, Valentin’s bio dad mystery came back into play as Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Chavez) pointed out that at least he knew who his own father was.</p><p>Valentin thought Mikkos Cassadine (John Colicos) was his father before the illegitimate twist was exposed, but what if he belongs to Mikkos’ brother instead?</p><p>As far as history goes, there’s no need to get hung up on the details. Plus, DNA tests are often rigged or mistaken on soaps.</p><p>General Hospital has proven that they’ll rewrite anything and everything for the sake of a current storyline, so that may be what they’re doing here, too.</p><p>Did Helena have Victor’s child – making Valentin a true Cassadine after all? We’ll keep you posted as other news and updates come in.</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say some jaw-dropping revelations are ahead this fall, so don’t miss what’s in store.</p><p>CDL will have other <a href=# rel=noopener>fantastic spoilers, updates and news to check out, so pop back in soon.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWpnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4yvoJysn6d6pK3SrJidoZ6aerOx1Z6YpZ2UYq60edWao56mpJ67tHnBoqalp5eesKK4jJ%2BYraCVp3q1vtSeZJyZo6iupbXNnmSanqSav26ty6Vm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
