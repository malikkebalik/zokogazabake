Last year, Elno told the employees who survived his mass layoffs in early November that they would receive 50% of their 2022 bonuses if they stayed with Twitter through the end of March 2023. In a turn of events that no one (everyone) saw coming, the bonuses were never paid out. So, his now former Senior Director of Compensation, Mark Schobinger, filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and 2,000 other current and former employees to get that money, baby. Despite Space Karen’s best efforts to move the case to Texas, a federal judge in San Francisco, where Twitter has its headquarters, has ruled that under California law, Twitter is in breach of contract. Pay up, Apartheid Clyde.</p><p>Elon Musk violated employee contracts by stiffing workers at his social media company X out of millions of dollars worth of promised bonuses, according to a San Francisco federal judge. US District Court Judge Vince Chhabria, who was appointed to the post by Barack Obama, allowed a lawsuit against the company formerly known as Twitter to proceed on Friday.</p><p>Mark Schobinger, who was Twitter’s senior director of compensation before leaving Musk’s company in May, filed a lawsuit against X in May alleging breach of contract. Schobinger alleged in the lawsuit that senior company officials made verbal promises both before and after Musk acquired the platform for $44 billion last year that its employees would be paid 50% of their 2022 bonuses if they stayed with the firm through the first quarter of this year.</p><p>But the bonuses were never paid, it was alleged in the complaint.</p><p>Schobinger’s lawsuit was filed on behalf of himself as well as approximately 2,000 other current and former employees of X. The plaintiffs are seeking in excess of $5 million. In denying Twitter’s motion to dismiss the case, Chhabria ruled that Schobinger plausibly stated a breach of contract claim under California law and he was covered by a bonus plan.</p><p>“Once Schobinger did what Twitter asked, Twitter’s offer to pay him a bonus in return became a binding contract under California law. And by allegedly refusing to pay Schobinger his promised bonus, Twitter violated that contract,” the judge wrote.</p><p>Twitter’s lawyers argued that the company made only an oral promise that was not a contract, and that Texas law should govern the case, according to Courthouse News, which first reported the ruling.</p><p>The judge ruled that California law governed the case and that “Twitter’s contrary arguments all fail.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>While $5 million is a lot of money to us peons, it’s really a drop in the bucket for the big tech companies. Twitter is certainly not worth close to the $44 billion that Musk paid for it, but it’s still reportedly worth somewhere around <a href=#>$19 billion</a>. Before Elon ran Twitter into the ground – whether intentionally or unintentionally – he could have paid out those bonuses. I know the whole industry has a volatile reputation for paying its workers well but treating them terribly, but this whole situation says a lot more about how bad of a leader and all-around sh–ty human being Musk is than anything else. I think Jacob Marley and the three spirits need to pay Elon a visit next Christmas.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/resume-genius-f2JMVDnarks-u.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pexels-yan-krukau-8867253.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pexels-keira-burton-6624297.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Picture note by CB: These are just stock photos of overworked people because I know you don’t want to look at Elno’s stupid face.
