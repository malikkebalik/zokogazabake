They may not necessarily want to be harangued by the paparazzi, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t crave the fame and attention that Dakota’s drawing.</p><p>According to sources, even Dakota’s boyfriend, <strong>Jordan Masterson</strong>, is starting to feel a little uncomfortable with Dakota’s newfound celebrity. Despite being the daughter of two famous celebrities, Dakota’s always been pretty low-key, although that’s all about to change thanks to her role in Fifty Shades of Grey. And in addition to that, <a rel=nofollow href=#>all her scenes</a> are either flirting with another man, being naked, or having sex with this man. It’s enough to make any boyfriend <a rel=nofollow href=#>jealous</a>, especially when that boyfriend is an actor who’s also spent years and years trying to build a career.</p><p>Anyway, sources close to the couple add that they’ve been moving apart for months now, and it looks like a split might be imminent. It’s not guaranteed – Dakota and Jordan have been together for long enough that they can fight through their problems and make it through. But we’ve seen this time and time again – low-key celebrity couple, doing just fine. One part of that couple suddenly blows up overnight with a franchise role, and the other gets left behind. Soon enough, they break up and the high-profile part of that couple ends up with an equally high-profile new partner.</p><p>What do you guys think? Will that happen with Dakota and Jordan?
