Byron and Urich divorced in March 2020. Kari used to be a vegetarian but switched to a pescetarian diet in her twenties. In a 2011 interview with "SuicideGirls," she said that she realized she was an atheist "somewhere around the second grade" after Kari's grandmother told her that her Buddhist friend wouldn't go to Heaven. Byron explained, "It got me really questioning. I just kind of quietly stopped believing, and I didn't go to church after that with my grandmother any more unless she really asked. I didn't believe it." In her memoir, Kari revealed that since the age of 12, she has "contended with severe bouts of depression," and she suffered from postpartum depression for six months after the birth of her daughter. Byron still makes art, and she has started creating paintings by exploding gunpowder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7ypqpomWSrr%2BwuoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
