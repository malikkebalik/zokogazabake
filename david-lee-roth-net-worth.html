Another Los Angeles band, Mammoth, occasionally rented Roth's band's PA system. Eddie and Alex Van Halen were part of Mammoth. They asked Roth to join them as their lead singer. In 1974, they changed the name of the band to Van Halen after discovering there was another band by the name of Mammoth. In the early days, Van Halen performed both original and cover songs.
