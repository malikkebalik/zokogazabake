Rodriguez/Getty Images</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>On January 28, <strong>Tammy Knickerbocker</strong> shared that she was worried about her daughter, <strong>Lindsey Knickerbocker</strong>.</p><p>“Worried about Lindsey, she is missing somewhere is Vegas, Henderson. Any knowledge of her please contact me. Thank you,” she shared on Facebook.</p><p>Not long after, a friend shared her post and asked that anyone they know in Vegas to keep an eye out for her. They wrote:</p><p>ATTN… Please share if you have friends in Vegas. If all my Vegas friends can keep an eye out for my friend Lindsey Knickerbocker she has been missing since Jan 9th. She called her mom, scared of this guy that picked her up out there and said she thinks he will hurt her… and then the phone got cut off. This guy got on her fb messaging and said that he last saw her on Sunset at Boulder Hwy. Bad area yes. Please share this post and contact Tammy Knickerbocker or Megan Michelle Knickerbocker. Email in photo. Please pray that she is okay!!!</p><p>According to <a href=#>Fox News</a>, the 34-year-old was last seen on January 9 after being release from jail after allegedly assaulting an officer for taking her dog. The outlet reported that Tammy claimed Lindsey was not allowed to have her dog at the hotel where she was staying.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>Tammy also told Fox News that she had last spoken to her daughter from a phone that was borrowing from a stranger.</p><p>“Please call me. Please call me. I need help,” Lindsey said the message left on Tammy’s phone.</p><p>After that, the former Real Housewives of Orange County star said she hadn’t heard anything from her daughter until January 16. She received a Facebook message that read, “I’m fine, I’m fine. I’ll call you tomorrow.”</p><p>Tammy didn’t hear from her daughter the next day, and two days after someone named “Eric” said her daughter was spotted staying in a tent. She didn’t hear anything else, and Tammy believes she may have been blocked by her daughter’s account.</p><p>According to the reality star, Lindsey had “a lot of drug issues.” Fox News said she had been using methamphetamine and that “she’s basically an addict at this point.”</p><p>Luckily, Lindsey has since been found.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>Tammy exclusively told <a href=#>People</a> on January 29 that she “finally hear” from her daughter.</p><p>“She saw all the messages on social media and called me through Facebook Messenger saying, ‘Mom, I’m okay. Leave me alone. Stop with all these messages. I don’t want to talk to anyone,’” the RHOC star said.</p><p>Tammy told the outlet that she learned Lindsey was arrested on New Year’s Eve and had spent a week in jail. She later filed a missing person report with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department before eventually hearing from her daughter.</p><p>“We talked for about a half hour,” she said about the interaction. “She seemed like herself.”</p><p>Tammy told People that she knows her daughter doesn’t want to hear from her, but she’s unclear about how to move forward. “She’s still my daughter, and I can’t write my daughter off. I want to help her in any way I can.”</p><p>Unfortunately for the family, this isn’t the first time Lindsey as gone missing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmq6CfmHq0wMCrqmackaq0qcDEq2Sfp6WjsW6txa2cq2WSmravs4ymoKyrmaO0brLOq2SwnZWgwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
