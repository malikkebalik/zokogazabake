Her friends were concerned about “strange noises” she was making, and she completely flipped out on the paramedics – it took multiple people to get her into the ambulance. Her representatives, of course, are claiming that it was “delerium as a result of exhaustion” and that there was no overdose. However, all of her scheduled appearances for the weekend have been cancelled.</p><p>TMZ has learned VH1 reality star Daisy de la Hoya was rushed to the hospital early this morning after paramedics responded to a 911 call for a “possible overdose.”</p><p>A source close to the situation says friends called 911 after they heard Daisy making strange noises in her friend’s Hollywood Hills home.</p><p>When firefighters and medics came to the house, sources tell us Daisy was acting “crazy” — yelling, screaming and thrashing around. It took multiple emergency personnel to get Daisy into the ambulance.</p><p>We’re told Daisy is currently receiving treatment at a Los Angeles area hospital.</p><p>Hours before the incident, TMZ cameras caught Daisy looking really, really out of sorts on her way out of Les Deux nightclub in Hollywood.</p><p>[from <a href=#>TMZ</a>]</p><p>I have to admit it, whenever they’re on, I love watching those trashy VH1 dating shows like Flava of Love, Rock of Love, and I Love New York. The latest in the same vein is Daisy of Love, which I must admit is entertaining. Daisy is charming in a way that Bret Michaels and Flava Flav are not, and she’s not quite as vapid as New York. One of my favorite lines from Daisy’s show: “This is Daisy of Love, not I Love Liquor.” Maybe Daisy should follow her own advice.</p><p>Of course, the friends never revealed what the “possible overdose” was on – just alcohol, or harder drugs? Either way, I hope this isn’t the sign of a bigger problem.</p><p>Here’s Daisy De La Hoya at the screening of “Next Day Air” in Hollywood on April 29th.
