It's an online wholesale grocery store that curates the best organic, non-GMO products at a discounted rate of 25% to 50% off retail prices to its members. Similar to Costco, you need a membership to shop or even just see the prices.&nbsp;</p><p>You have two membership options. The annual membership costs $59.95 (or $5/month), billed once yearly. If you opt to do a monthly membership instead, you'll pay $12 per month.&nbsp;You'll get free shipping on your first order over $25, plus all orders $49 or more.&nbsp;Thrive Market currently ships to all contiguous US states.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2 data-toc-label="How it works" id=how-it-works class=toc-anchor><strong>How it works</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Sign up for free</strong>: You can browse the catalog, see member savings, and receive 25% off your first purchase.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noindex" data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=6617813eecb9040372cf2012c3251f77efcabeb01c70d660f50a68ced26c6cfc&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thrivemarket.com%2Fhow-it-works" class=sj-link>Start a free 30-day trial</a></strong>: You can start a free 30-day membership trial with your first purchase on Thrive Market.

The healthy eating community is an intense one, so it's nice that Thrive Market makes use of all that helpful, accumulative passion in a way that I, a newcomer, can utilize too.</p><p>The 25% to 50% price difference could help close the gap between the sometimes inflated "organic" prices at some grocery stores, making Thrive Market a viable choice for the average person on a budget.&nbsp;</p><p>When we price-checked some of the items, Thrive Market was not always cheaper, but when it was, it usually offered a large enough gap in savings to be substantial overall. You could save more by buying local, though your selection may not be as wide or the process as convenient.</p><p>And if you're concerned about getting value out of your membership, Thrive Market <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noindex" data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=44cb78a7dc87bb79d65bd5d53910daad5badb3216439ab7cfa31f6a22554c28e&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thrivemarket.com%2Fsavings-guarantee" class=sj-link>guarantees its annual membership will pay for itself</a>.

If I had signed up for an annual membership, I would have paid off the $60 fee in my first order. The food was delicious, and I discovered new better-for-you snacks. I also found Thrive to be surprisingly cheaper for some of my favorite skincare products.</p><p>Thrive Market carries ethically sourced <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noindex" data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=4145b02f408b1b3da32755b66d1b5c947275e6f141a5bc5dc8eaa0fc11e829a4&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thrivemarket.com%2Fc%2Fmeat-seafood%3Ffilter%255Bcategories%255D%3D971" class=sj-link>meat and seafood</a> in large bulk "box" options, but the options are slightly more limited than the average meat and seafood counter at a grocery store. I also don't have space in my freezer or fridge to handle over $100 worth of meat, but it could be another great place to see savings if you do.</p><p>Former senior reporter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Owen Burke</a>, a lifelong fisherman with a background in commercial fishing and tending oyster bars, tried out Thrive's bevy of seafood on offer:&nbsp;"This is not something you'll want to buy unless you have a solid shelf of freezer space to spare, but I'll commend Thrive and call this nothing short of a feat on their part."</p><p>Burke received six different species of seafood and everything was wild-caught. His final take: "It varies depending on what you get, but in all, you're looking at 10-15 meals of fresh-frozen (that's fish that was frozen fresh, as soon as it was processed) wild-caught protein of high quality. That's something like $11-$17 dollars a dish, which is about as good as you're going to do with high-quality fresh seafood unless you've got friends at the fishing docks."</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2 data-toc-label="The bottom line" id=the-bottom-line class=toc-anchor>The bottom line</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Thrive Market</span></span></figure><p>I wish it were possible to find everything here (fresh fruit, more options for meat), but ultimately the discounts and the easy delivery make using Thrive worth it. And I wish it was always free shipping instead of just orders of $49 and up, but I typically clear that just by restocking my favorite basics. All in all, I liked using Thrive Market regularly for healthy snacks, healthy-but-fast foods, and kitchen basics like pasta sauce and olive oil.</p><p>If you need an added incentive, Thrive Market also has a program&nbsp;called "<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noindex" data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=1496b992527308f563f0b341822a730c9d6cc67c0414d0ddcd5143c86bc22c98&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thrivemarket.com%2Fgiving" class=sj-link>Thrive Gives</a>," which gifts a free membership to someone in need through <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Feeding America and the Boys and Girls Club or directly through the site</a> for every paid membership.
