After 34 years of marriage, the singer’s wife, Deborah, has decided to leave the famous guitarist. Apparently Santana also cheated on Deborah a handful of times during their marriage, but I’m placing the bulk of the blame on the ties. They make you look like you’re wearing a hallucination around your neck.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/side-shoes_iaec1063120.jpg align=right hspace=10 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Carlos Santana and his wife of 34 years are divorcing, according to court documents. Deborah Santana, who in her 2005 memoir “Space Between the Stars” described her guitarist husband as being unfaithful, filed for divorce in Marin County Superior Court on Oct. 19, citing irreconcilable differences. Carlos Santana’s publicist, Michael Jensen, said the case is “a private matter and there is no comment.”</p><p>The musician has said he knew he made mistakes in his marriage. “I sincerely apologized to her and to my kids when I wasn’t in my right mind and did something hurtful,” Carlos Santana said after the memoir was published. “It has helped me become more humble and to try harder to be the man she wants me to be.”</p><p>The Santanas have also been business partners. They created the Milagro Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports underprivileged children. Earlier this year, they announced plans to create three Mexican restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area named Maria, Maria after one of Carlos Santana’s Grammy-winning songs. The couple have three children, ages 17, 22 and 23.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Yahoo! News</a>]</p><p>I’m guessing that – despite the infidelities – problems really arose when Carlos started designing women’s footwear. I mean you can be as straight as the day is long – if you design ladies strappy sandals, I’m going to think there’s something wrong with you.</p><p><strong>Picture note by Jaybird:</strong> Header image of Carlos and Deborah at the Youth Aids Benefit Discussion Panel in 2004.
