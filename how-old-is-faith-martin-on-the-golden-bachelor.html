Yikes!</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>Out of the three women left, Faith Martin exudes an extremely youthful energy in comparison to her competitors.

Faith has two sons and four grandkids that she loves more than anything in this world. She’s also a woman of many talents, which she continues to do professionally — like radio hosting, teaching, and singing. Faith is a fun thrill-seeker and has checked many goals off her bucket list like diving with sharks, riding a motorcycle, and getting a tattoo, but she’s still looking for someone to enjoy the thrills of life with.
