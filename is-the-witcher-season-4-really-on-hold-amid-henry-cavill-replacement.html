A lot of fans made good on their promise to boycott the show, sending a clear message to the powers that be about how much Henry Cavill’s performance as the titular Geralt of Rivia means to them.</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=true>Now, amid this period of uncertainty for the entire industry — what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA</a> strike bringing almost every production to a resounding halt — and Netflix’s own crew dealing with the aftermath of Cavill’s departure and the presumably challenging process of onboarding Liam Hemsworth, rumors are circulating online that seem to suggest the fourth season is going to be on hold for the time being. But how much credence can you give the latest scuttlebutt?</p><h2 id=h-is-the-witcher-season-4-on-hold data-injectable=false><strong>Is The Witcher season 4 on hold?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/witcher-geralt-of-rivia-henry-cavill.jpg><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>The new scuttlebutt that has taken the community by storm is courtesy of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Redanian Intelligence</a>. The outlet, which is dedicated to the coverage of Witcher scoops, has had an impeccable track record when it comes to reports of this nature, so when they recently revealed that filming for season 4 has been postponed to 2024, more than a few found the coincidence to be a bit too dubious.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Of course, the website maintains that the exact reasons for this delay are unknown, but principal photography was originally supposed to start in September 2023 and last until May 2024. Now, the team is looking at 2024, possibly early 2024, to schedule their shooting blocks.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=false>For our money, this is probably due to the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike, and not Liam Hemsworth replacing Henry Cavill. At worst, such a transition would give the production crew a few weeks’ delay, so it’s safe to say that the switcheroo debacle is not to blame for this particular development.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ytn55lp57BpLTEq2SsnZGovK95k2apnpmcocZuu81mn6iklGKurrXDZp%2BepqKueqSt1aKjpWWimr2trcKepJ6mpGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
