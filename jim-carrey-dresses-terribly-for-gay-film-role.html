He’s currently shooting I Love you Phillip Morris, a gay prison escape comedy, of all things. Yes I know, it’s a genre that’s been done to death. Carrey is walking around in some absolutely ridiculous clothes on the movie’s set. I’m praying to God that it takes place in the seventies/eighties. Otherwise there is just no excusing that wardrobe team.</p><p>These are the first pictures of a very camp-looking Carrey in character for his role in prison break comedy I Love You Phillip Morris. Dressed in a tight black T-shirt, white jeans, a huge gold lion’s head buckle on his belt, and a liberal helping of fake tan, comedy star Carrey is almost unrecognizable. Carrey is seen here during filming getting to grips with actor Rodrigo Santoro, with his hand on his co-stars behind.</p><p>In the film, which is based on a true story, he plays a con artist who is sent to prison where he falls in love with his cellmate Phillip Morris. His cellmate is played by British actor Ewan McGregor in the forthcoming movie from the makers of the film Bad Santa. McGregor’s character is freed from jail, while Carrey’s character Steven Russell is sentenced to a total of 144 years behind bars after he tries to escape four times.</p><p>Last week actors McGregor and Jim Carrey reportedly visited a gay bar together in preparation for their roles. The actors were spotted attending ‘Martini Tuesday’ at Miami’s Halo bar. A source said: “Jim and Ewan looked like they were having a great time. They were laughing and joking and looked as though they were really trying to get into character.”</p><p>[From the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>]</p><p>I’m embarrassed to admit that I still enjoy an occasional Jim Carrey comedy. They’re very hit-or-miss anymore, but any movie with tight pants deserves to be seen, in my humble opinion.</p><p>Here are some pictures from the set. Try to keep your panties on, everyone.
