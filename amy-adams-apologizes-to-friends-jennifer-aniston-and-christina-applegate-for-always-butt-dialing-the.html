In a new interview, <a href=# rel=dofollow>Amy Adams</a> hilariously admitted that she has a serious problem with butt dialing her celebrity friends. While chatting with Seth Meyers on <a href=# rel=dofollow>Late Night With Seth Meyers</a> earlier this week, Amy publicly apologized to anyone that she’s accidentally called over the years and confessed that actress <a href=# rel=dofollow>Christina Applegate</a> is at the top of her accidental call list.</p><p>“I have fat cheeks,” Amy, 43, shared. “And I keep accidentally calling her when I smile during other phone calls. And then I don’t say anything and hang up, which is really rude.” Amy then told Seth that it might be hard for Christina to forgive her because she’s mistakenly called her around 300 times within two months!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/amy-adams.jpg><p>The Sharp Objects star also took the time to publicly apologize to another big star who might have once received a weird phone call from her. “I think I FaceTimed [<a href=# rel=dofollow>Jennifer Aniston</a>] on accident too from my bed,” she revealed. “I’m not sure it connected so, who knows what happened there.” Sorry, Jen!</p><p>Seth, who was shocked by Amy’s confessions, joked that Christina and Jennifer might not find her accidental prank calls amusing after watching his show. If they find out that Amy knowingly didn’t say anything on the phone, then it might ruin their friendship. But Amy quickly reassurerd him that she will make an effort to break her awkward pattern.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/amy-adams-darren-de-gallo.jpg><p class=caption>Amy and her husband, Darren Le Gallo.

I’m very, very sorry, it’s very, very rude.” Amy didn’t reveal if she had more celebrities to apologize to but she appeared to be very relieved after finally clearing the air. We just hope that Jen and Christina have a good sense of humor so the next time she sees them, it won’t be awkward!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apLJlkZmurr%2BMo5ynppmbsrN5wKegrKyfo3qktNGiqq2hnpZ6orzPpZygmaSaenKCknJqcGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WebBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
