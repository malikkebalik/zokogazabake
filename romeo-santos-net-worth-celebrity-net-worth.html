Considered one of the most influential Latin groups in music history, Aventura released five studio albums and had such hit songs as "Cu√°ndo Volver√°s," "Obsesi√≥n," "Un Beso," "Mi Corazoncito," "Por Un Segundo," and "Dile Al Amor." After the first breakup of the band in 2011, Santos embarked on a successful solo career.</p><p>In July 2014, Romeo Santos became one of only a few musical acts who has ever <a href=#>successfully sold out two shows at Yankee Stadium's 50,000 seats for a concert</a>. That's an accomplishment that bands like Metallica, Pink Floyd and fellow hometown hero <a href=# title="Jay-Z Net Worth">Jay-Z</a> could not accomplish (technically Jay sold out Yankees stadium with <a href=# title="Justin Timberlake Net Worth">Justin Timberlake</a>).</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Romeo Santos was born on July 21, 1981 in the Bronx borough of New York City to a Puerto Rican mother and a Dominican father. He attended public school in the Bronx, and sang in his church choir.</p><h2 id=aventura><strong>Aventura</strong></h2><p>In 1993, brothers Lenny and Max Santos (no relation to Romeo) formed a band with their cousin called Banda Sue√±o. The cousin didn't stick around for long, prompting Lenny and Max to seek a new singer. They were eventually introduced to Romeo Santos, who subsequently brought on his cousin Henry. The four boys formed the band Los Tinellers, and performed locally in the Bronx. In 1995, the the group was discovered by manager Elvin Polanco, who helped the boys record their first studio album, "Trampa de Amor." The following year, Los Tinellers began working with manager Julio C√©sar Garc√≠a, who reinvented the group as Aventura. In 1998, the group signed with Premium Latin Music, and in 1999 released its debut album, "Generation Next." The album included six songs from "Trampa de Amor," including the hit "Cu√°ndo Volver√°s." In 2002, Aventura released its second album, "We Broke the Rules," which launched the international hit single "Obsesi√≥n." The album was especially successful in France and Italy, where it peaked at number one.</p><p>Aventura's third studio album, "Love & Hate," came out in 2003. That was followed by the 2004 live album "Unplugged." Aventura went on to have its mainstream breakthrough in 2005 with the studio album "God's Project," which peaked at number five on the Top Latin Albums chart and launched such hit singles as "Ella y Yo" and "Un Beso." In 2007, the group sold out Madison Square Garden in New York, becoming the first bachata act to do so. The concert was turned into the live album "Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden"; a DVD of the concert was also released. Aventura released its fifth and final studio album, "The Last," in mid-2009. The album became the group's highest-charting release, peaking at number one on the Top Latin Albums chart and number five on the Billboard 200. It spawned the hit singles "Por Un Segundo," "All Up 2 You," "Su Veneno," and "Dile Al Amor." Aventura broke up in 2011, but later reunited for various concerts and tours. The group played its final concert in late 2021 in the Dominican Republic.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-179924 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Romeo-Santos.jpg alt width=594 height=417 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-179924 class=wp-caption-text>Rodrigo Varela/Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>After Aventura broke up in 2011, Santos embarked on a solo career.
