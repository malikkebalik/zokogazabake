Staley told Bloomberg TV that "The investigation is actually focused on transparency, and whether I was transparent and open with the bank and with the board with respect to my relationship with <a href=#>Jeffrey Epstein</a>." Staley told colleagues that he expects to leave Barclays by the end of 2021 and could step down at the annual meeting in May 2021.</p><p>Staley's attempts in 2016 to discover a whistleblower's identity were investigated for over a year by British regulators, an investigation which was one of the first tests of the UK's "Senior managers regime", intended to make high-level banking officials personally accountable. On 20 April 2018, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulatory Authority announced that Staley could stay on as CEO, though he would have to pay a fine.. Staley was fined £642,430 by the FCA and Barclays said it would cut £500,000 of his bonus over the matter. In May 2017, "email prankster" James Linton began his spree with Staley pranked with an acrostic alluding to the whistleblower affair.</p><p>As of May 2017, Staley was backing his brother-in-law Jorge Nitzan in a dispute that Aceco, a Brazilian technology company founded by the Nitzan family, have with the private equity firm KKR, also an important client of Barclays. In turn, KKR stopped inviting Barclays to participate in its deal making.</p><p>In 2013, Staley left <a href=#>J.P. Morgan</a> after more than 30 years to join BlueMountain Capital as a managing partner. In May 2015, he was elected to the board of directors of the Swiss global financial services company UBS as a new member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and of the Risk Committee. However, on 28 October 2015, it was announced that Staley would become group chief executive of Barclays, effective 1 December 2015. To avoid any conflicts of interest, UBS accepted his resignation from all of his functions at UBS with immediate effect. In March 2016, he has given his vision for the future of Barclay’s investment bank although the changes he has brought until then have not been well received by the markets.</p><p>Staley has bought 2.8m shares in Barclays at 233p – the lowest price at which they have traded since January. Barclays has a policy that directors should own shares worth four times their salaries, which Staley has now achieved, as his salary currently amounts to £1.2m. However, his total remuneration package, including his salary, a fixed pay allowance to avoid the EU cap on bonuses, annual bonuses of up to £2.1m and a long-term incentive plan of £3.2m, is worth £10m.</p><p>In 1979, after graduation, Staley joined Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York. From 1980 to 1989, he worked in the bank's Latin America division, where he served as head of corporate finance for Brazil and general manager of the company's Brazilian brokerage firm. In the early 1990s, Staley became one of the founding members of J.P. Morgan's equities business and ran the Equity Capital Market and Syndicate groups. In 1999, he became head of the bank's Private Banking division which, under his leadership, improved profitability threefold during two years. In 2001, he was promoted to CEO of <a href=#>J.P. Morgan</a> Asset Management and ran the division until 2009. During his tenure, <a href=#>J.P. Morgan</a> Asset Management's client assets expanded from $605 billion to nearly $1.3 trillion. Staley has also been noted for his work on J.P. Morgan's strategic investment in Highbridge Capital Management by being named as one of the twenty hedge fund superstars at <a href=#>J.P. Morgan</a>. His contribution to <a href=#>J.P. Morgan</a> becoming a LGBT friendly company was also recognized. In 2009, Staley was promoted to Chief Executive of the Investment Bank. In this position, Staley was responsible for overseeing and coordinating the firm's international efforts across all lines of business.</p><p>James Edward "Jes" Staley (born December 27, 1956), is an American banker, and the group chief executive (CEO) of Barclays.
