Here's what we know about this 'Modern Family' character and his experience with a reiki master.</p><p>Published on September 17, 2021</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_32>Mitch and Cam had someone else move onto their property during one episode of <a href=#>Modern Family</a>. Unbeknownst to them, this reiki master was actually homeless and lived inside Lily’s cardboard princess castle.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_18>Here’s what we know about the reiki master named Barry from ABC’s comedy series, portrayed by James Marsden.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Modern-Family-Reiki.jpg><h2 id=h-there-was-a-new-guest-staying-with-the-pritchett-tucker-family>There was a new guest staying with the Pritchett-Tucker family&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-3_38>Mitchell Pritchett is known for being somewhat uptight. He doesn’t share his food. He doesn’t like a messy home. This character also had a hard time believing in Reiki, a Japanese form of alternative medicine called energy healing.</p><p id=par-4_56>However, it was easier for this character to believe when the handsome Barry moved into the same property as Cameron and Mitch. This occurred during the “Slow Down Your Neighbors” episode of <a href=#>ABC’s comedy series</a>. Although Mitchell was judgemental at first, his partner encouraged him to have an open mind, especially because Barry was so good-looking.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-james-marsden-starred-as-barry-in-this-episode-of-modern-family>James Marsden starred as Barry in this episode of ‘Modern Family’</h2><p id=par-5_41>During the “Slow Down Your Neighbors,” episode of this series, James Marsden portrayed Barry. This character even got Mitchell Pritchett to relax by doing a reiki session on him. Unfortunately, this relaxed state didn’t last for a long period of time.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_53>It turned out that this character didn’t move into the upstairs unit, as <a href=#>Mitch and Cam</a> assumed. When Barry said he moved in, he meant he moved into Lily’s outdoor playhouse. A cardboard princess castle is no place for a grown man and, after a tussle with Cameron, this character left their property.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_47>At the same time, this episode featured the iconic battle between Clare Dunphy and a speeding car in her neighborhood. Things get more complicated when Phil learns that his client is driving that car. This episode also featured Manny and Gloria’s impromptu bicycle lessons by Jay Pritchett.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-james-marsden-isn-t-the-only-celebrity-who-had-a-modern-family-cameo>James Marsden isn’t the only celebrity who had a ‘Modern Family’ cameo</h2><p id=par-8_38>Marsden wouldn’t be the only actor with an appearance on Modern Family. ABC’s comedy series had cameos from Millie Bobby Brown, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Peyton Manning. There were also recurring characters portrayed by Fred Willard and Adam DeVine.</p><p id=par-9_33>For one episode, Dan Levy acted as one of Mitch and Cam’s bitter former renters for the upstairs apartment. The character, named Jonah, appeared during the season 10 episode titled “A Sketchy Area.”</p><p id=par-10_40>Marsden is known for his appearance in several Disney-related projects, including X-Men and Enchanted. He had a starring role in the rom-com film, The Notebook, as well as movies like The Best of Me, 27 Dresses, and Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><p id=par-11_38>This show has since premiered its final season on the television network, ABC. <a href=#>Modern Family</a>, including the “Slow Down Your Neighbors” episode, is available for streaming on Hulu.
