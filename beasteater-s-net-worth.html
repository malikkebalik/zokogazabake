Margarucci’s net worth is estimated to be over $700k. She rose to fame on TikTok by uploading short dances, lip-syncs, and comedy videos. Her videos get millions of views and likes, and because of that she has amassed over 19.2 million followers on TikTok.</span></p><p><span>She is also known for her unique sense of hairstyles, makeup, and modeling, and is among the most trending creators on TikTok. She is primarily famous for comedy video clips, and dancing videos and performs lip-syncs on TikTok but is also popular on Instagram with over 887k followers on the platform with several eye-catching Instagram pictures and videos.</span></p><p><span>Margarucci collaborated with Olin to create the YouTube channel titled “Marcus and Steph”, which currently has over 391k subscribers and features long-form as well as short-form content, retaining the same charm that their personalities have on TikTok and Instagram.</span></p><p><span>Margarucci first discovered YouTube as the sole source of dance inspiration. The creators and their content kept Margarucci company when she needed it most. Her most notable inspiration was choreographer Matt Steffanina, who did more than that. Steffanina’s how-to-dance videos helped Margarucci sharpen the skills she needed to go from a rookie to being a central player in several hip-hop dance crews.</span></p><p><span>Margarucci and Olin, who has his own account but frequently features in Margarucci’s videos, have focused on making a mix of dance and comedy content.</span></p><p><span>Over the past two years, her account has grown to more than 19 million followers, and in the last two months has seen more traffic than ever. In the first week of August last year, Margarucci’s TikTok content collectively garnered more than 31 million views, 4.5 million likes, and 14.2K shares.</span></p><p><span>Much like YouTube content helped Margarucci build the foundations of her dance career, her own TikTok content is now helping her build out more than what she’d hoped for, like debuting her own products and becoming a singer/songwriter. It’s letting her follow in the footsteps of the YouTube creators who inspired her out of her rough patch.</span></p><p><span>Margarucci currently is most active on the short-form video-sharing app TikTok, where she has over 19.2 million fans. She has also garnered a lot of attention on Instagram, racking in 887k followers as of 2022. She also has a self-titled YouTube account, but she is the least active there, which directly influences her subscriber count at 1.7k.</span></p><p><span>She also uses the YouNow platform for streaming content. Margarucci collaborated with Olin to create the YouTube channel titled “Marcus and Steph”, which currently has over 391k subscribers and features long-form as well as short-form content, retaining the same charm that their personalities have on TikTok and Instagram.</span></p><h2 id=what-is-beasteater-net-worth-0 class=accordion-title><span>Personal Information</span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/wiki/ic-pencil.svg width=16 height=16 alt="Edit icon" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><table><tbody readability=3.2101910828025><tr><td data-row=1><span>Name</span></td><td data-row=1><span>Stephanie Margarucci</span></td></tr><tr readability=4><td data-row=2><span>Date Of Birth (Age)</span></td><td data-row=2><span>August 2, 1997, 24 years old</span></td></tr><tr><td data-row=3><span>Net Worth</span></td><td data-row=3><span>&lt;$700k</span></td></tr><tr><td data-row=4><a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a></td><td data-row=4><span>887k followers</span></td></tr><tr><td data-row=5><a href=# rel=nofollow>TikTok</a></td><td data-row=5><span>19.2 million followers</span></td></tr><tr readability=1.6666666666667><td data-row=6><a href=# rel=nofollow>YouTube</a><span> (Personal channel)</span></td><td data-row=6><span>1.7k subscribers</span></td></tr><tr readability=1.0361445783133><td data-row=row-78cd><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.youtube.com/c/MarcusandSteph</a><span> (Channel with Marcus Olin)</span></td><td data-row=row-78cd><span>391k subscribers</span></td></tr><tr><td data-row=7><span>Twitter</span></td><td data-row=7><span>N/A</span></td></tr><tr><td data-row=8><span>Height</span></td><td data-row=8><span>5 feet 6 inches</span></td></tr><tr><td data-row=9><span>Nationality</span></td><td data-row=9><span>American</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=what-is-beasteater-net-worth-1 class=accordion-title><span>Sources Of Income</span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/wiki/ic-pencil.svg width=16 height=16 alt="Edit icon" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><p><span></span></p><p class=ql-align-center><span>Source - Instagram</span></p><p><span>Margarucci’s net worth is estimated to be over $700k.
