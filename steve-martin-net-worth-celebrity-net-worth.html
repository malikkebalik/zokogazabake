Steve Martin has been cracking people up with his brand of intelligent humor since the late 60s. As a writer for "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour," he won an Emmy Award at age 23. From there, he went on to write for "The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour" and "The <a href=# title="Glen Campbell Net Worth">Glen Campbell</a> Goodtime Hour," among other programs.</p><p>He moved out from behind the camera in 1969, and thus began a long and very successful career as a performer. His early years were a little rough, but by the mid-70s, he'd hit his stride. Frequent appearances performing stand-up on "The Tonight Show Starring <a href=# title="Johnny Carson Net Worth">Johnny Carson</a>" (he appeared 56 times between 1972 and 1992), "The Gong Show," and "Saturday Night Live," made him a household name.&nbsp; His comedy albums were also immensely popular, and earned him multiple Grammys. By the late 70s, his stand-up performances were filling arenas, so it seemed only logical to shift his focus to feature film work. Film had always been his first love, and the first short film he wrote and appeared in, "Live Action," was subsequently nominated for an Oscar. Since then, he has gone on to appear in such popular projects as "The Jerk," "Pennies from Heaven," "All of Me," "Roxanne," "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles," "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," "Parenthood," "Father of the Bride," "Leap of Faith," "The Shopgirl," and "The Pink Panther" reboot.&nbsp; He has also released eleven studio albums, some comedy, and some music. An accomplished bluegrass musician, he has had three albums reach #1 on the US Bluegrass charts, and has won two Grammy Awards for his music projects, in addition to his comedy albums. He's also a prolific writer and has published numerous scripts, novels, and children's books.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Steve Martin was born Stephen Glenn Martin on August 14, 1945, in Waco, Texas.
